### Links

* doing it right is important: https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/deep-dives/why-are-hyperlinks-blue/
- Optimal text accessibility with the background color and surrounding text.
  Your design decisions shouldn’t be the reason a user can’t access content on a page.
- Interactive states should always be styled in your stylesheets.
  Examples include: touch, visited, hover, active and focus. TODO
- Links and buttons should be large enough to tap or click.
  You can’t be sure how people are interacting with your content on devices
  by using styluses, fingers, mice or trackpads.
  It’s your job to make sure your links are easy to navigate and have enough space around them.
- Always make sure that a hyperlink stands out from the rest of the surrounding content.
  Sometimes that means you need an underline, or a background color,
  or maybe just maybe, you need the color blue.
