/* FYI
 * On all browsers, for "monospaced" elements (code, kbd, pre, samp),
 * the default font-size=1em ends up smaller (ex. seen 13px for a root font-size of 16px)
 * This is an old design choice.
 * Last checked: Chrome102, Firefox91 and Safari15
 * Some resets try to [cancel/fix this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38781089/font-family-monospace-monospace)
 * however since all browsers agree on it, this is NOT needed in a reset.
 * While improving the situation could be valid, this belongs to another layer.
