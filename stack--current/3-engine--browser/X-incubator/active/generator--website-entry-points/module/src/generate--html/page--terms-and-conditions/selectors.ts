## 10. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold me harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorney fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Apps or your violation of these Terms.

I may, in my sole discretion, terminate these Terms and your access to all or part of the Apps, at any time and for any reason, without prior notice or liability.

### 11.4 Effect of Termination

By continuing to access or use the Apps after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

## 13. GOVERNING LAW

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Country/State], without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

If you have any concern or dispute about the Apps, you agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting me.

### 14.2 Binding Arbitration

Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party.

## 15. SEVERABILITY

If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

## 19. CONTACT INFORMATION

## 20. FORCE MAJEURE

I will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance resulting from causes beyond my reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, pandemic, war, terrorism, riots, civil unrest, government action, labor disputes, or technical failures beyond my control.

## 21. ASSIGNMENT

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without my prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms without such consent will be null and of no effect. I may assign or transfer these Terms, at my sole discretion, without restriction.
