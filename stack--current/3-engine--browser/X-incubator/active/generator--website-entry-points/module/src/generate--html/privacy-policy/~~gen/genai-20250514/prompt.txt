I'm a professional software engineer. As a hobby, I'm writing some websites, mobile apps or 3rd party apps. Write an official privacy policy, taking into account that I'm a hobbyist, not selling any data and only collecting "needed for operational reasons" data. write a legally correct one valid in most countries.
