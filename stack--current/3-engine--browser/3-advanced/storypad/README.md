Storybook is great but very hard to set up, cf. https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/setup#configure-storybook-for-your-stack

Fer ex. at this date (2023) I can't use Storybook with parcel :(

This is an alternative which is:
- API compatible
- framework-agnostic
- bundler agnostic

The core change is an inversion of control:
- Storybook: storybook loads, discover stories, build them and display them
- Storypad: a bootstrap code loads the stories (thanks to recent bundler's feature of "import glob"), build everything then invoke Storypad and pass them

```ts
import type { Meta, Story } from '@offirmo-private/storypad/types'

import Component from './index.tsx'

import { EXAMPLE } from '../__fixtures/index.ts'

/////////////////////////////////////////////////

export default {
	component: Component,
	args: {
		state: EXAMPLE,
	},
	decorators: [
		(stuff: any) => {
			import('@offirmo-private/css--framework')
			return stuff
		},
	]
} satisfies Meta

export const Default = {} satisfies Story

//export const Custom = {}

```
