NEW 2024/09 [Scheduling APIs](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6031161734201344)
> Userspace tasks often have varying degrees of importance (related to user experience),
> but the Platform lacks a unified API to schedule prioritized work.
> The postTask API allows developers to schedule tasks (javascript callbacks)
> with a native browser scheduler at 3 levels of priority: user-blocking, user-visible, and background.
> It also exposes a TaskController, which can be used to dynamically cancel tasks and change their priority.

Also it's not semantic.

What we want (semantic)
- dezalgo
- critical but out of the main thread (when loading a webpage for ex.)
- 3 levels of priority: user-blocking, user-visible, and background https://chromestatus.com/feature/6031161734201344
-

Current primitives (not semantic):
1. sync
1. async
   1. next tick
   1. microtask
   1. setImmediate https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/setImmediate https://github.com/YuzuJS/setImmediate https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/setimmediate-vs-settimeout-in-javascript
   1. set timeout 0
   1. requestAnimationFrame  ~1/60s
   1. set timeout n
   1. requestIdleCallback https://caniuse.com/requestidlecallback
   1. (experimental) scheduler.postTask() https://devdocs.io/dom/scheduler/posttask

> A task is any JavaScript code which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms
> such as initially starting to run a program, an event callback being run, or an interval or timeout being fired.
> These all get scheduled on the task queue.

> each time a task exits, the event loop checks to see if the task is returning control to other JavaScript code.
> If not, it runs all the microtasks in the microtask queue.
> The microtask queue is, then, processed multiple times per iteration of the event loop, including after handling events and other callbacks.
> If a microtask adds more microtasks to the queue by calling queueMicrotask(),
> those newly-added microtasks execute before the next task is run.
> That's because the event loop will keep calling microtasks until there are none left in the queue, even if more keep getting added.

Note that Chrome timeouts are capped at >=1ms
