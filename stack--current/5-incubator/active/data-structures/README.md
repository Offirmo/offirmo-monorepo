For personal usage but also for learning/practice purpose

THERE ARE TONS OF POSSIBLE APIs FOR GRAPHS

HENCE THIS LIB STARTS WITH ACTUAL USE CASES:
- file tree
- craft recipe
- todo list with dependencies


## Concepts

* Abstract Data Types https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure

* https://builtin.com/data-science/data-structures
1. Linear data structures
   * array
   * linked list
   * stack
   * queue
1. Non-linear data structures
   * Graph
     * directed graphs, weighted graphs, cyclic/acyclic...
     * Tree "hierarchical" data structures
       * binary trees, binary search trees, red-black trees, weight-balanced trees and binary heaps...
3. Hash tables


## Pragmatism

* UID = dual
  * internal, efficient UID used internally
  * external, user-provided UID
* upsert vs insert
* immutability?
  * it's hard to code properly
* made to be serializable
* flat = the tree is flattened into an array at the top



## Learning

Common operations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)
- Enumerating all the items
- Enumerating a section of a tree
- Searching for an item
- Adding a new item at a certain position on the tree
- Deleting an item
- Pruning: Removing a whole section of a tree
- Grafting: Adding a whole section to a tree
- Finding the root for any node
- Finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes


traversal
- depth first
- breadth first
- in-order
- post-order
- level-order
