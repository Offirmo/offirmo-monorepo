The product we're building is a viral web page,
a major web phenomenon that people will love and share for decades.

We are recreating a modern version of the viral old "hampsterdance" page.
Of course we're not naming our page with this name.
Also we're not copying, we're creating a new thing only drawing inspiration.

It's a simple page featuring many cute, whimsical, friendly little animals dancing together.

-- TODO move into a "need to know"
-- The animals are animated and dancing happily. They are multiple rows of animals dancing all with various colors and sizes.
-- The page is very simple, without any heavy interface.
-- The page is very creative, colorful, and fun.
