5 Harsh Truths for Success from Linus Torvalds https://medium.com/codex/5-harsh-truths-from-linus-torvalds-406ab20cea02
5 mantras -- 1% better = You don’t need to change the world. Just make something — anything — 1% better, every day. Movement of the smallest rocks can cause the greatest landslides.
5 mantras -- Don’t get stuck = when I feel stuck it is because I am being too stubborn to change, too egotistical to ask for help, or too tired to invite creativity into my thinking. There is rarely no way out.
5 mantras -- Find joy in the journey = We give so much of our lives to our work, so we should put some effort into making it something that brings us joy. We probably find that joy in different places, but it’s important that we know what fuels us. Our work, and our lives, are better for it. 
5 mantras -- Prototype the path = The only way through is to do. Hard problems get a hell of a lot easier when we get our hands dirty, equip our curiosity, and start trying things out.
5 mantras -- You are enough = I don’t tell myself this often enough. I’d dare to say that you don’t either. But it’s a mantra that I repeat to myself often. 
5 mantras = by Christopher Davis (burnout)

capitalism -- issues -- inability to collectively improve, ex. global warming
capitalism -- late stage
capitalism -- W. H. Mallock -- is justified because it permits the most talented members of society to use the less talented for the sake of maximizing efficiency. Labor, for him, was an inert mass that was useless unless those with managerial and entrepreneurial talent set them to work. Hence, wealth is created, not by labor, but by the knowledge and ability of those who control labor. Maximization of corporate profits means in this case that the most entrepreneurial, innovative and inventive segment of society has used labor and resources to create wealth. In Mallock's view labor, by itself, creates nothing; it's not the wrench that puts the machine together, but the genius who invented it.

go-for-it window = Large gaps between accelerating technologies and stagnating social norms create lucrative new business opportunities. But they are only available for a short time when people can capitalize on the difference between the real and perceived state of the world.

goals -- S.M.A.R.T. -- 03 A (Aspirational yet Achievable) Write Individual Goals that are within your control and influence, but make them aspirational – push yourself (and us) to be bold and ambitious!

goals -- S.M.A.R.T. -- 04 R (Relevant) Align the goal with your team’s mission, values, department/team OKRs, and strategic and business objectives. Clearly articulate the reason(s) for pursuing the goal and how this contributes to our short- and long-term objectives.

Horseshoe Theory = Extreme opposites tend to look the same. For example, a far-right movement and a far-left movement can be equally violent or desire a similar outcome. People on both sides are more similar to each other than they are to people in the center.

microaggressions
mimetic Theory of Conflict: People who are similar are more likely to fight than people who are different. That’s why Civil Wars and family feuds create the worst conflicts. The closer two people are and the more equality between them, the greater the potential for conflict.
mimetic Theory of Desire: Humans are like sheep. We don’t know what we want, so we imitate each other. Instead of creating our own desires, we desire the same things as other people. The entire advertising industry is built on this idea.

Occam’s Razor: If there are multiple explanations for why something happened and they are equally persuasive, assume the simplest one is true. In the search for truth, remove unnecessary assumptions. Trust the lowest-complexity answer.

opportunity Cost: By reading this tweet, you are choosing not to read something else. Everything we do is like this. Doing one thing requires giving up another. Whenever you explicitly choose to do one thing, you implicitly choose not to do another thing.

outside context problem (OCP) = a problem that is "outside the context" as it is generally not considered until it occurs, and the capacity to actually conceive of or consider the OCP in the first place may not be possible or very limited (i.e., the majority of the group's population may not have the knowledge or ability to realize that the OCP can arise, or assume it is extremely unlikely). An example of OCP is an event in which a civilization does not consider the possibility that a much more technologically advanced society can exist, and then encounters one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession#Outside_Context_Problem 
Overton Window: You can control thought without limiting speech. You can do it by defining the limits of acceptable thought while allowing for lively debate within these barriers. For example, Fox News and MSNBC set limits on what political thoughts they consider acceptable, but in the grand scheme of things, they’re both fairly conventional. The political spectrum stretches far beyond the ideas they entertain, but ideas outside their limits are shunned.
paradigm shift https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift
paradox of Abundance: The average quality of information is getting worse and worse. But the best stuff is getting better and better. Markets of abundance are simultaneously bad for the median consumer but good for conscious consumers.
paradox of Consensus: Under ancient Jewish law, if a suspect was found guilty by every judge, they were deemed innocent. Too much agreement implied a systemic error in the judicial process. Unanimous agreement sometimes leads to bad decisions.
paradox of Specificity: Focus isn’t as constraining as it seems. In the age of the Internet, when everybody has Google search and personalized social media feeds, differentiation is free marketing. The more specific your goal, the more opportunities you’ll create for yourself. Narrowing your aperture can expand your horizons.

Pareto efficiency
Parkinson’s Law: Work expands to fill the time available. People don’t want to look like they’re lazy, so they find extra tasks to tackle, even if they’re trivial. If you have six months to complete a project, it will take six months to complete. Set deadlines accordingly.

penny Problem Gap: Economists assume demand is linear, but people’s behavior totally changes once an action costs money. If the inventors of the Internet had known about it, spam wouldn’t be such a problem. If sending an email cost you $0.001, there’d be way less spam.

Find your own style, then run with it. Create intellectual real estate for yourself. The Internet rewards unique people. Find your unique combination of skills, interests, and personality traits.

ring theory -- 01 The person in the center ring can say anything she wants to anyone, anywhere. She can kvetch and complain and whine and moan and curse the heavens and say, "Life is unfair," and, "Why me?" That's the one payoff for being in the center ring. Everyone else can say those things too, but only to people in larger rings.
ring theory -- 02 When you are talking to a person in a ring smaller than yours, someone closer to the center of the crisis, the goal is to help. Listening is often more helpful than talking. But if you're going to open your mouth, first ask yourself if what you are about to say is likely to provide comfort and support. If it isn't, don't say it. Don't, for example, give advice. People who are suffering from trauma don't need advice. They need comfort and support. So say, "I'm sorry," or, "This must really be hard for you," or, "Can I bring you a pot roast?" Don't say, "You should hear what happened to me," or, "Here's what I would do if I were you." And don't say, "This is really bringing me down."
