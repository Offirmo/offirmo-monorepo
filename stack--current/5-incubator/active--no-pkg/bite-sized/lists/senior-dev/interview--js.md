Questions asked in screening interview were about Javascript fundamentals, e.g. types of objects, variable declaration, scopes and the meaning of "this", as well as asking to interpret snippets of Javascript code and explain what it does given a certain input. Technical questions involved simulations of real world problems, where you are expected to explain your solution including the time/memory demands of your algorithm. One technical question was web-focused and involved building a simple UI using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The behavioural component was all standard questions asking to recount an experience in different work situations, with lots of follow up questions about how you interpret your experience and what you learned. All the interviews after the screen heavily emphasised the ability to effectively communicate your thoughts to the interviewer, listen and respond quickly to additional requirements and feedback that the interviewer gives.
