I finally (recently) made it to FAANG Director  without ever being promoted in my entire career.

Started as a new grad (out of grad school) 15 years ago.

Entire career was in big tech companies (including 3 “FAANG “ companies).

Never stayed at a company longer than 3 years.

Never been promoted at any company.

Never worked more than 20 hours per week, if that, at any job, any time in the past 15 years (except the first 6 months 15 years ago <— a mistake).

How?

1. Always negotiated good, impactful work

2. but also push back and take up the bare minimum

3. Do a really good job at it

4. Market the heck out of the work that you do

5. Be super nice to people

6. Be extra nice with your manager

7. Flee (saying you are not a good fit) as soon as you know the manager is not amenable to such stuff

  7a. Flee could be an internal transfer, or external
  
  7b. Shortest tenure in a team was 2 months; I have changed teams internally  3 times (tenures of 2 months, 5 months, 7 months)

8. Consciously take up work that helps colleagues. I spend 3-4 hours every week helping  colleagues.

9. Invest in upskilling. While I work only 20 hours I am a hard worker and have constantly invested in myself (leetcode back in the day, systems knowledge, books on management and leadership, providing talks at conferences and publishing. For
   Someone with just a Masters degree I have a decent publication record and am considered somewhat of an expert in my area).

Btw: I learnt all this from my first manager (RIP, he was from the Midwest, who would give me words of wisdom over beer 🍺 during lunch and I joined his team a year before his retirement)

Why I am posting this?

I see a lot of really stupid managers (micromanagers) who are hell-bent on “extracting” the maximum work out of their reports, while working for multi-billion dollar monopolies.
It’s almost like these guys have no common sense and try to one up their peer Eng leaders.
Frequently they are not working on the most impactful work but do tedious stuff. Take it easy folks.
Focus on the value you provide but if you are providing a lot of value, make sure you extract some benefit for your teams.

New btw, is my own company that I use to manage my rental properties.

## Day performance (minimum pre-requisite)


### perf categories
* demonstrable impact from main role
  * ex. dev = code, PRs, tickets implemented, features shipped, bugs fixed
* Engineering Excellence AKA “I do hard things”
  * Code reviews that I’ve given that I’m proud of.
* Direction = Technical decisions and proposals
* Organizational Impact
  * interviews
  * mentoring


### evidences / data signals
* Take weekly notes!
* Beware of recency bias! Polish your start & end of review period!

1:1 notes

Pull requests
Jira tickets
Documentation, Architectural diagrams and other artifacts

Relevant Slack threads, e.g. debating a technical decision (links & screenshots)

Projects you’ve both led and contributed to

Mentorship and development 

Positive feedback from others:
    Kudos
    Slack call-outs
    Thanks in retro
    Verbal shout-outs from your manager or key stakeholders, public or private

Interviewing and recruiting successes/wins

Leadership opportunities, directly connected to your technical efforts or otherwise (e.g., community efforts, team-building exercises, implementing team-wide processes, helping with new hires onboarding, share performance/self-development tools) 

### self-assessment

### individual goals

See SMART goals (MModels)


Descriptive action
(what you plan to do and who you plan to do it with)

Outcome you want to achieve
(result)

Specific success measure
(metric)

Due date
(timeline)


Also:
- manager: 1. Build a shared understanding of expectations and goals from the outset
- manager: 2. Distribute opportunities, support, and resources equitably
- manager: 3. Hold yourself accountable for providing timely, fair, and actionable feedback.


## progression


> Promotion is this carrot that dangles in front of you. When you focus on it, you’d be miserable.
> Always focus on actual work and scope. You’d be rewarded by jumping ship sooner than the next promo lands.


P3 should be learning how to engineer high quality software
P4 should be doing the lion’s share of engineering
P5 should be leading your team’s execution on engineering
P6 should be driving action in your teams, after identifying opportunities themselves


## job change

### offboarding
* internal blog posts
* networking
* private files on own computers
* CV blurbs, incl. numbers!! 


### onboarding
* meet everyone
  * "what should I know?"
  * "who should I meet?"
