Big Dumb Object (BDO) is any mysterious object, usually of extraterrestrial or unknown origin and immense power, in a story which generates an intense sense of wonder by its mere existence. To a certain extent, the term deliberately deflates the intended grandeur of the mysterious object. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dumb_Object

progression -- horizontal = Recruit > Soldier (max level) > Learn to wield guns (expac 1) > Learn to wield swords (expac 2) > Learn to do magic stuff (expac 3) > and so on
progression -- horizontal = you don't get more powerful. You get more flexibility, more options, more utility, more mobility, new non-combat features. Every expansion adds new stuff and new ways to improve your character/account, it's just (mostly) not stuff that increases your raw numbers in combat.
progression -- vertical = "You're not great, your gear is great"
progression -- vertical = Recruit > Soldier > Soldier wielding Gun > Soldier wielding bigger guns > Soldier wielding bigger bigger guns (because somehow ambient mobs continue to get stronger lmao)
progression -- vertical = the world is getting smaller
progression -- vertical vs. horizontal = WoW vs GW2 https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10wiwfq/can_someone_explain_horizontal_progression/
