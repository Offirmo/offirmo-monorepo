GRASP (object-oriented design) = General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns = nine fundamental principles in object design and responsibility assignment https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)
GRASP -- 1 Information expert = Assign responsibility to the class that has the information needed to fulfill it
GRASP -- 2 Creator = Who creates object A? In general, Assign class B the responsibility to create object A if one, or preferably more, of the following apply...
GRASP -- 3 Controller = A controller object is a non-user interface object responsible for receiving or handling a system event
GRASP -- 4 Indirection = Assign the responsibility to an intermediate object to mediate between other components or services so that they are not directly coupled
GRASP -- 5 Low coupling = lower dependency between the classes, change in one class having a lower impact on other classes, higher reuse potential
GRASP -- 6 High cohesion = keep objects appropriately focused, manageable and understandable
GRASP -- 7 Polymorphism = responsibility for defining the variation of behaviors based on type is assigned to the type for which this variation happens
GRASP -- 8 Protected variations = Identify points of predicted variation or instability; assign responsibilities to create a stable interface around them

monolith = over time become poorly structured, containing many different, sometimes competing conventions. These conventions and “styles” sprawl throughout the monolith and make it difficult to understand what is going on. Because structures are built with different conventions, to work in the monolith safely, you have to examine everything to make sure you understand this instance of this pattern. It’s not safe to assume anything. This, combined with the lack of boundaries in the monolith means that every change incurs a huge cost in examination and understanding before it can be safely implemented. This skews developer performance to tenure - the longer you have been staring at the code, the more you have wrapped your head around and the faster you can go (mostly). New developers should not be worried about the time it takes to be effective in the monolith - it's the monolith’s fault, not yours."

OOP -- fake strengths -- Dependency inversion principle
OOP -- fake strengths -- design benefits
OOP -- fake strengths -- encapsulation = Once an Object is created, knowledge of its implementation is not necessary for its use + Objects have the ability to hide certain parts of themselves from programmers. This prevents programmers from tampering with values they shouldn’t. Additionally, the object controls how one interacts with it, preventing other kinds of errors. For example, a programmer (or another program) cannot set the width of a window to -400.

pattern -- matching = checking a given sequence of tokens for the presence of the constituents of some pattern. In contrast to pattern recognition, the match usually has to be exact: "either it will or will not be a match." The patterns generally have the form of either sequences or tree structures. Uses of pattern matching include outputting the locations (if any) of a pattern within a token sequence, to output some component of the matched pattern, and to substitute the matching pattern with some other token sequence (i.e., search and replace).
