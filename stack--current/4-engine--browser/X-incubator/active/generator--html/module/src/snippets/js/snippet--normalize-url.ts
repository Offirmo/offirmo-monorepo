	 * ex if we're located by our parent folder (implicit file, a lot of servers automatically do that)
	 *    foo/bar/index.html   served as  /foo/bar (no trailing slash)
	 * It messes with relative paths!
	 * ex. (continued) link rel=site.webmanifest = /foo/site.webmanifest

	 * Could we use <base> instead? Pb. is when the content is served on different domains: dev, staging, prod...
	 *
	 * SO we decide to ensure folders have a trailing slash
	 * ex. /foo/bar/index.html => ✔ no change
	 * ex. /foo/bar/           => ✔ no change
	 * ex. /foo/bar            => ✖ REDIRECT foo/bar/
