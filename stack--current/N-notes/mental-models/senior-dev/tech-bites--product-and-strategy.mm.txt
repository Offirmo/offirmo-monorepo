marketing -- "killer app"
marketing -- case studies
marketing -- case studies -- "flagship app" It's not that there wasn't a lot of interest in WPF, it's just there weren't any flagship apps showing off what it could do that previous frameworks couldn't.

They aren't wrong. https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/x0nu7h/comment/im9kesb/

pricing strategy
principle -- end-to-end principle = fundamental principle of the Internet in which the role of a network is to reliably deliver data from willing senders to willing receivers
principle -- right of exit = users of a platform can easily go elsewhere if they are dissatisfied with it. This requires interoperability, countering the network effects
principles -- canva -- Beginners become experts = While we should make sure that new customers have a great experience creating their first design, they should also find it exciting to create their 100th design and be able to create new and unique content each time they come back. This means gradually handing over the reins of design to them as they become more confident with the product and with their own skills.
principles -- canva -- Great defaults = It's not a sin to have more powerful options available to our customers, but if they don't tweak any settings or change any values, they should still end up with a great design. Make sure that any new feature is optimized to create great design right out of the box
principles -- canva -- Just simple enough  = We always strive for a simple product that is understandable by a non-designer. This means no jargon and no knobs that only a professional can figure out how to use. But "simple" is not the opposite of "powerful". Canva needs to provide the flexibility and usefulness of a real design tool in an easy-to-use package.
principles -- canva -- Understand the problem = Having a clear definition of the problem that you're trying to solve before you start designing is incredibly important to the design process– it can stop you from chasing your own tail, trying to find the solution to a problem that keeps changing
principles -- canva -- Weigh up every line = We want customers to feel a connection with the people who make Canva. This should be reflected in the tone of voice and interface cues that we use to communicate with our customers. We are all humans, so let your human side show, but know when it's appropriate to be more playful and when you have to communicate serious matters.
principles -- canva -- Words are design = What customers read is as important to their experience as the interactions and visuals. Clear and meaningful labels and written content are an important part of an interface, therefore language and writing are an important skill to have as a designer.

scaling -- managers who get promoted quickly into upper manager and leader positions often try to apply what worked locally to what might feasibly work globally. When that fails, their first instinct is to carve out the autonomy and boundaries they once enjoyed as managers of smaller teams, which works in the short term but can lead to problems when collaborating across messier boundaries.

stalking horse = figure used to test a concept or mount a challenge on behalf of a third party. If the idea proves viable or popular, the third party can then declare its interest and advance the concept with little risk of failure. If the concept fails, the third party will not be tainted by association with the failed concept and can either drop the idea completely or bide its time and wait until a better moment to launch an attack https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking_horse
