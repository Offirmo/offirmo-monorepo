block -- genesis = The first block in a blockchain, used to initialize a particular network and its cryptocurrency https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#genesis-block
block = batch of transactions
blockchain -- intelligence = for investigations, risk, and security https://www.chainalysis.com/
blockchain -- transaction -- step 1 – Record the transaction
blockchain -- transaction -- step 2 – Gain consensus = Most participants on the distributed blockchain network must agree that the recorded transaction is valid. Depending on the type of network, rules of agreement can vary but are typically established at the start of the network.
blockchain -- transaction -- step 3 – Link the blocks = Once the participants have reached a consensus, transactions on the blockchain are written into blocks equivalent to the pages of a ledger book. Along with the transactions, a cryptographic hash is also appended to the new block. The hash acts as a chain that links the blocks together. If the contents of the block are intentionally or unintentionally modified, the hash value changes, providing a way to detect data tampering. Thus, the blocks and chains link securely, and you cannot edit them. Each additional block strengthens the verification of the previous block and therefore the entire blockchain. This is like stacking wooden blocks to make a tower. You can only stack blocks on top, and if you remove a block from the middle of the tower, the whole tower breaks.
blockchain -- transaction -- step 4 – Share the ledger = The system distributes the latest copy of the central ledger to all participants.
blockchain -- transaction = shows the movement of physical or digital assets from one party to another in the blockchain network. It is recorded as a data block and can include details like these: who, what, when, where, why, how much, preconditions
blockchain = database = stores data in chronologically consistent blocks that you can delete or modify only with consensus from the peer-to-peer network. Built-in mechanisms prevent unauthorized transaction entries and create consistency in the shared view of these transactions. As a result, you can use it to create an unalterable or immutable ledger for tracking all types of transactions https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/ https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/blockchain/

This is what the rest of crypto is often accused of, too. In substance, skeptics say,  tokens are stocks, protocols are companies, labs entities are c-suites, staking yields are dividends, token burns are buybacks, airdrops are sometimes IPOs, DAOs are general partnerships, and stablecoins are bank accounts. It’s often hard to argue with. https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-substance-vs-form

decentralization = avoiding points of trust, minimizing censorship vulnerabilities and minimizing centralized infrastructure dependency
decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) = agreed-upon smart contract that automates decentralized decision-making over a pool of resources (tokens). Users with tokens vote on how resources get spent, and the code automatically performs the voting outcome.
decentralized identity = technology that aims to give individuals more control and ownership over their digital identity. In traditional online systems, users often rely on centralized identity providers (like social media platforms or email services) to manage their identities and access various online services. Decentralized identity shifts the control of identity information back to the individual user. It uses globally unique identifiers associated with a decentralized identifier (DID) document. This document contains public keys, cryptographic material, and service endpoints related to identity. The technology uses selective disclosure to share specific identity attributes and minimize exposure to personally identifiable information (PII) during identity verification processes.

smart contracts = self-implementing contracts with predefined rules written in code. They automatically enforce the terms of the agreement when certain conditions are met. For example, if a contract says that ownership of an item transfers to whoever pays for it, you simply send the asking price to that contract. The ledger then automatically updates by using a transaction in the next block to reflect you as the new owner.
smart property = ownership of an underlying physical device https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_Property
social tokens = digital assets issued by creators to monetize their content and engage with their fan base https://www.coinbase.com/en-au/learn/crypto-basics/what-are-social-tokens-and-how-do-they-redefine-value-in-the-creator-economy

Sybil attack = actor pretending to be a lot of actors to control the chain. Resistance to this type of attack is essential for a decentralized blockchain and enables miners and validators to be rewarded equally based on resources put in. Proof-of-work and proof-of-stake protect against this. https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/#sybil-chain

tokens -- vs coins = digital assets that live on a specific blockchain. Instead of having their own network, like coins, tokens are stored on other blockchains. Because they use a token standard, all of the tokens on a given blockchain are interoperable, as long as they come in the same format. Tokens come in two main forms; fungible (such as ERC-20 tokens) and non-fungible (NFTs). https://www.ledger.com/ru/academy/topics/crypto/what-is-token-gating
tokens = cryptographic representations of ownership, access rights, or other forms of value. Ex. physical and digital assets like real estate, stocks, commodities, art, music, and even in-game items

Web Ontology Language (OWL) = language for defining ontologies, or formal representations of knowledge and relationships between concepts. You can use it to specify classes, properties, and instances, as well as facilitate reasoning and inferencing.
Web1 = read-only
Web2 = interactive, but challenges with centralized providers: data portability, data abuse (privacy), censorship, ban (democracy)...
Web2.5 = where content creators have benefited from the rise of social media, but what they create is owned by centralized groups
Web3 -- decentralization = aim to distribute and store data in decentralized networks. In these networks, different entities own the underlying infrastructure and the user pays directly to the storage provider to access that space. Decentralized applications also store information replicas in multiple locations and ensure data consistency throughout. Individual users can control where their data resides instead of handing it over to a centralized infrastructure. Decentralized internet users can sell their own data if they want to.
Web3 -- interoperability = Web 3.0 aims to create more interconnections between diverse technologies, so data flows between different platforms without intermediaries. Interoperability makes data portable so users can seamlessly switch between services while maintaining their preferences, profiles, and settings.
Web3 -- semantic web = enables applications to perform complex tasks by understanding the content and context of web data. It uses metadata and artificial intelligence to provide meanings (semantics) to user-generated data. Web 3.0 aims to move more fully towards semantic web technologies currently found in some aspects of existing web technologies. For example, a search engine provides more accurate and contextually relevant search results, and intelligent agents assist users in performing tasks more efficiently.
Web3 -- trustlessness = In centralized web applications and services, users often need to place trust in a central authority to manage their data, transactions, and interactions. These central authorities have control over user data, and they can manipulate the system's rules. The data may be subject to security risks or mismanagement, potentially resulting in the loss or misuse of user information. In contrast, Web3 introduces trustlessness, so users can engage in transactions and interactions without trusting any specific party.
Web3 = "the distributed web" = a set of technologies that enables hosting of content and web applications in a serverless manner by leveraging distributed systems and consensus protocols https://developers.cloudflare.com/web3/
Web3 = umbrella term for technologies like blockchain that decentralize data ownership and control on the internet. Most internet applications are controlled by centralized entities that determine how they save and use end-user data. https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/web3/
