Blast
block -- genesis = The first block in a blockchain, used to initialize a particular network and its cryptocurrency https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#genesis-block
block = batch of transactions
blockchain -- accounts -- 1/3 EOA (Externally Owned Account) = key pair + balance, can send transactions
blockchain -- accounts -- 2/3 SCA (Smart Contract Account) = conatins code, responds to transactions
blockchain -- accounts -- 3/3 account abstraction (AA) = smart contract accounts that can initiate and execute transactions without needing an EOA. "Aims to make web3 so seamless that everyday users might not even notice they're using it, while still reaping all its benefits" https://blog.quicknode.com/eip-7702-explained-the-future-of-ethereum/
blockchain -- accounts -- delegation = 7702
blockchain -- accounts -- interactions -- connected = ex. connect wallet to a dapp
blockchain -- accounts -- interactions -- imported = access private key (should rarely do this unless it's a wallet app)
blockchain -- accounts -- interactions -- linked = ex. track activity "watch"
blockchain -- accounts = ~wallet
blockchain -- intelligence = for investigations, risk, and security https://www.chainalysis.com/
blockchain -- permissioned = ex Hyperledger Fabric by IBM https://www.kaleido.io/blockchain-blog/what-is-hyperledger-fabric
blockchain -- permissioned = private, use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network. Ex. facebook Libra/Diem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Permissioned_(private)_blockchain
blockchain -- permissionless = public, anyone can join and participate in the network. Ex. Bitcoin, Ethereum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Permissionless_(public)_blockchain
blockchain -- permissionless v. permissioned -- cons = implicit premanent 100% attack, either pirate or politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Disadvantages_of_permissioned_blockchain
blockchain -- permissionless v. permissioned -- pros = "permissioned blockchains can guarantee a certain level of decentralization, if carefully designed, as opposed to permissionless blockchains, which are often centralized in practice" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Permissioned_(private)_blockchain
blockchain -- transaction -- step 1 – Record the transaction
blockchain -- transaction -- step 2 – Gain consensus = Most participants on the distributed blockchain network must agree that the recorded transaction is valid. Depending on the type of network, rules of agreement can vary but are typically established at the start of the network.
blockchain -- transaction -- step 3 – Link the blocks = Once the participants have reached a consensus, transactions on the blockchain are written into blocks equivalent to the pages of a ledger book. Along with the transactions, a cryptographic hash is also appended to the new block. The hash acts as a chain that links the blocks together. If the contents of the block are intentionally or unintentionally modified, the hash value changes, providing a way to detect data tampering. Thus, the blocks and chains link securely, and you cannot edit them. Each additional block strengthens the verification of the previous block and therefore the entire blockchain. This is like stacking wooden blocks to make a tower. You can only stack blocks on top, and if you remove a block from the middle of the tower, the whole tower breaks.
blockchain -- transaction -- step 4 – Share the ledger = The system distributes the latest copy of the central ledger to all participants.
blockchain -- transaction = shows the movement of physical or digital assets from one party to another in the blockchain network. It is recorded as a data block and can include details like these: who, what, when, where, why, how much, preconditions
blockchain -- transaction model -- UTxO (BitCoin?) vs Account (Eth?) = an architecture decision with pro & cons https://www.kaleido.io/blockchain-blog/utxo-vs-account-model
blockchain -- vs. network = blockchain is only a block of Bitchoin/Eth, and is only a database
blockchain = database = stores data in chronologically consistent blocks that you can delete or modify only with consensus from the peer-to-peer network. Built-in mechanisms prevent unauthorized transaction entries and create consistency in the shared view of these transactions. As a result, you can use it to create an unalterable or immutable ledger for tracking all types of transactions https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/ https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/blockchain/
blockchains -- arrow of time = the way of solving double spending ~forcing the "database" to only move forward (with PoW initially) https://mail.blockworks.com/p/bitcoin-s-arrow-of-time

challenges -- double spend
challenges -- form vs substance = "the prosecution asked jurors to ignore the form of X — non-custodial, immutable smart contract code — and instead focus on the substance of what it enabled: money laundering"  In short, prosecutors accused X of using a technical innovation to cleverly sidestep the law. This is what the rest of crypto is often accused of, too. In substance, skeptics say,  tokens are stocks, protocols are companies, labs entities are c-suites, staking yields are dividends, token burns are buybacks, airdrops are sometimes IPOs, DAOs are general partnerships, and stablecoins are bank accounts. It’s often hard to argue with. https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-substance-vs-form

challenges -- Regulatory compliance = Web3 applications must follow existing data protection and financial security requirements.
challenges -- scalability = a primary concern, because lack of trust is expensive: blockchain networks get very expensive and computationally demanding as data volumes increase
challenges -- User experience and adoption = Complex interfaces and a steep learning curve limit mainstream adoption. Improving the user experience by designing intuitive interfaces that abstract the complexities of blockchain technology is essential.
CLOB "Central Limit Order Book" = system where all buy and sell orders for an asset are collected, sorted, and matched based on price and time priority
colored coins = on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments https://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit

consensus -- &mechanisms = complete stack of ideas, protocols and incentives that enable a distributed set of nodes to agree on the state of a blockchain https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/
consensus = a general agreement has been reached. Consider a group of people going to the cinema. If there is no disagreement on a proposed choice of film, then a consensus is achieved. If there is disagreement, the group must have the means to decide which film to see. In extreme cases, the group will eventually split https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/
corporate blockchains = "Big companies launching L1s is kind of a rejection of the L2 thesis, but it’s even more of a rejection of the Solana thesis" https://blockworks.co/news/stripe-circle-l1s-solana
crapto = anything not BitCoin (maybe Ether?)

decentralization = avoiding points of trust, minimizing censorship vulnerabilities and minimizing centralized infrastructure dependency
Decentralized Application (DApp) = A web page that relies upon one or many Web3 platform APIs which are exposed to the web page via the Wallet https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963
decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) = agreed-upon smart contract that automates decentralized decision-making over a pool of resources (tokens). Users with tokens vote on how resources get spent, and the code automatically performs the voting outcome.
decentralized identity = technology that aims to give individuals more control and ownership over their digital identity. In traditional online systems, users often rely on centralized identity providers (like social media platforms or email services) to manage their identities and access various online services. Decentralized identity shifts the control of identity information back to the individual user. It uses globally unique identifiers associated with a decentralized identifier (DID) document. This document contains public keys, cryptographic material, and service endpoints related to identity. The technology uses selective disclosure to share specific identity attributes and minimize exposure to personally identifiable information (PII) during identity verification processes.

Web Ontology Language (OWL) = language for defining ontologies, or formal representations of knowledge and relationships between concepts. You can use it to specify classes, properties, and instances, as well as facilitate reasoning and inferencing.
Web1 = read-only
Web2 = interactive, but challenges with centralized providers: data portability, data abuse (privacy), censorship, ban (democracy)...
Web2.5 = where content creators have benefited from the rise of social media, but what they create is owned by centralized groups
Web3 -- decentralization = aim to distribute and store data in decentralized networks. In these networks, different entities own the underlying infrastructure and the user pays directly to the storage provider to access that space. Decentralized applications also store information replicas in multiple locations and ensure data consistency throughout. Individual users can control where their data resides instead of handing it over to a centralized infrastructure. Decentralized internet users can sell their own data if they want to.
Web3 -- interoperability = Web 3.0 aims to create more interconnections between diverse technologies, so data flows between different platforms without intermediaries. Interoperability makes data portable so users can seamlessly switch between services while maintaining their preferences, profiles, and settings.
Web3 -- semantic web = enables applications to perform complex tasks by understanding the content and context of web data. It uses metadata and artificial intelligence to provide meanings (semantics) to user-generated data. Web 3.0 aims to move more fully towards semantic web technologies currently found in some aspects of existing web technologies. For example, a search engine provides more accurate and contextually relevant search results, and intelligent agents assist users in performing tasks more efficiently.
Web3 -- trustlessness = In centralized web applications and services, users often need to place trust in a central authority to manage their data, transactions, and interactions. These central authorities have control over user data, and they can manipulate the system's rules. The data may be subject to security risks or mismanagement, potentially resulting in the loss or misuse of user information. In contrast, Web3 introduces trustlessness, so users can engage in transactions and interactions without trusting any specific party.
Web3 = "the distributed web" = a set of technologies that enables hosting of content and web applications in a serverless manner by leveraging distributed systems and consensus protocols https://developers.cloudflare.com/web3/
