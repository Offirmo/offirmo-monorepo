blockchain -- transaction -- step 1 – Record the transaction
blockchain -- transaction -- step 2 – Gain consensus = Most participants on the distributed blockchain network must agree that the recorded transaction is valid. Depending on the type of network, rules of agreement can vary but are typically established at the start of the network.
blockchain -- transaction -- step 3 – Link the blocks = Once the participants have reached a consensus, transactions on the blockchain are written into blocks equivalent to the pages of a ledger book. Along with the transactions, a cryptographic hash is also appended to the new block. The hash acts as a chain that links the blocks together. If the contents of the block are intentionally or unintentionally modified, the hash value changes, providing a way to detect data tampering. Thus, the blocks and chains link securely, and you cannot edit them. Each additional block strengthens the verification of the previous block and therefore the entire blockchain. This is like stacking wooden blocks to make a tower. You can only stack blocks on top, and if you remove a block from the middle of the tower, the whole tower breaks.
blockchain -- transaction -- step 4 – Share the ledger = The system distributes the latest copy of the central ledger to all participants.
blockchain -- transaction = shows the movement of physical or digital assets from one party to another in the blockchain network. It is recorded as a data block and can include details like these: who, what, when, where, why, how much, preconditions
blockchain = database = stores data in chronologically consistent blocks that you can delete or modify only with consensus from the peer-to-peer network. Built-in mechanisms prevent unauthorized transaction entries and create consistency in the shared view of these transactions. As a result, you can use it to create an unalterable or immutable ledger for tracking all types of transactions.

bridging
challenges -- Governance = can be challenging in decentralized systems . It requires effective structures that involve community participation and don’t centralize power.
challenges -- Regulatory compliance = Web3 applications must follow existing data protection and financial security requirements.
challenges -- scalability = a primary concern, because lack of trust is expensive: blockchain networks get very expensive and computationally demanding as data volumes increase
challenges -- User experience and adoption = Complex interfaces and a steep learning curve limit mainstream adoption. Improving the user experience by designing intuitive interfaces that abstract the complexities of blockchain technology is essential.

decentralization -- metric -- insider attack test = if your team itself tries to attack the system, how much will break, and how much harm could you do?
decentralization -- metric -- the walkaway test = if your team and servers disappear tomorrow, will your application still be usable?
decentralization avoiding points of trust, minimizing censorship vulnerabilities, and minimizing centralized infrastructure dependency. The natural metrics are
Decentralized Autonomous Organisation, or DAO
decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) = agreed-upon smart contract that automates decentralized decision-making over a pool of resources (tokens). Users with tokens vote on how resources get spent, and the code automatically performs the voting outcome.
decentralized identity = technology that aims to give individuals more control and ownership over their digital identity. In traditional online systems, users often rely on centralized identity providers (like social media platforms or email services) to manage their identities and access various online services. Decentralized identity shifts the control of identity information back to the individual user. It uses globally unique identifiers associated with a decentralized identifier (DID) document. This document contains public keys, cryptographic material, and service endpoints related to identity. The technology uses selective disclosure to share specific identity attributes and minimize exposure to personally identifiable information (PII) during identity verification processes.

Hyperledger Fabric = open-source project with a suite of tools and libraries. Enterprises can use it to build private blockchain applications quickly and effectively. It is a modular, general-purpose framework that offers unique identity management and access control features. These features make it suitable for various applications, such as track-and-trace of supply chains, trade finance, loyalty and rewards, and clearing settlement of financial assets. https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/what-is-hyperledger-fabric/

InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) = a decentralized and distributed file storage system that provides a more efficient and resilient way to store and access content on Web 3.0. It gives a unique cryptographic hash (content-based address) to every file. It uses a peer-to-peer network, where each IPFS node acts as a client and server. Nodes cooperate to store, retrieve, and distribute content across the web, eliminating the need for centralized servers. https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/

open source -- benefits -- enabling permissionless third-party improvements
open source -- benefits -- reducing the risk of proprietary lockin
open standards -- striving for interoperability. If you want to introduce a new feature that is not well-served by existing standards, write a new proposal in collaboration with others. Applications can be rated by which proposals they are compatible with.

smart contract -- auditing = https://iosiro.com/services/smart-contract-auditing
smart contracts -- bug = ex. of loss of everything
smart contracts = self-implementing contracts with predefined rules written in code. They automatically enforce the terms of the agreement when certain conditions are met. For example, if a contract says that ownership of an item transfers to whoever pays for it, you simply send the asking price to that contract. The ledger then automatically updates by using a transaction in the next block to reflect you as the new owner.

Web Ontology Language (OWL) = language for defining ontologies, or formal representations of knowledge and relationships between concepts. You can use it to specify classes, properties, and instances, as well as facilitate reasoning and inferencing.
Web1 = read-only
Web2 = interactive, but challenges with centralized providers: data portability, data abuse (privacy), censorship, ban (democracy)...
Web3 -- decentralization = aim to distribute and store data in decentralized networks. In these networks, different entities own the underlying infrastructure and the user pays directly to the storage provider to access that space. Decentralized applications also store information replicas in multiple locations and ensure data consistency throughout. Individual users can control where their data resides instead of handing it over to a centralized infrastructure. Decentralized internet users can sell their own data if they want to.
Web3 -- interoperability = Web 3.0 aims to create more interconnections between diverse technologies, so data flows between different platforms without intermediaries. Interoperability makes data portable so users can seamlessly switch between services while maintaining their preferences, profiles, and settings.
Web3 -- semantic web = enables applications to perform complex tasks by understanding the content and context of web data. It uses metadata and artificial intelligence to provide meanings (semantics) to user-generated data. Web 3.0 aims to move more fully towards semantic web technologies currently found in some aspects of existing web technologies. For example, a search engine provides more accurate and contextually relevant search results, and intelligent agents assist users in performing tasks more efficiently.
Web3 -- trustlessness = In centralized web applications and services, users often need to place trust in a central authority to manage their data, transactions, and interactions. These central authorities have control over user data, and they can manipulate the system's rules. The data may be subject to security risks or mismanagement, potentially resulting in the loss or misuse of user information. In contrast, Web3 introduces trustlessness, so users can engage in transactions and interactions without trusting any specific party.
Web3 = "the distributed web" = a set of technologies that enables hosting of content and web applications in a serverless manner by leveraging distributed systems and consensus protocols https://developers.cloudflare.com/web3/
Web3 = umbrella term for technologies like blockchain that decentralize data ownership and control on the internet. Most internet applications are controlled by centralized entities that determine how they save and use end-user data. https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/web3/
