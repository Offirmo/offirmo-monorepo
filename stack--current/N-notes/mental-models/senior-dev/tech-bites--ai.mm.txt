AI model collapse = as AI grows, systems are trained on their own outputs, gradually losing accuracy, diversity, and reliability. This occurs because errors compound across successive model generations, leading to distorted data distributions and "irreversible defects" in performance.

ASL "AI Safety Level" https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-ai-safety-level-asl-where-we-now-siddhesh-joglekar-gieof/
ASL-1 = This level involves smaller, simpler AI models with minimal risk. It’s the starting point, where basic safety checks are in place, but the technology itself is relatively low-stakes .
ASL-2 = At this stage, larger, more complex AI models are introduced, requiring heightened safety protocols to ensure responsible usage. These models can handle more tasks but are still largely controllable and predictable.
ASL-3 = This level signifies a significantly higher risk as AI models become increasingly powerful. More sophisticated safety and security measures are essential because the technology is now capable of complex problem-solving and may pose unintended risks if misused or uncontrolled.
ASL-4+ = (Speculative) The highest level, ASL-4, is where AI technology enters speculative, highly autonomous territory. Models at this level may start exhibiting autonomous behaviors, making independent decisions, and even potentially circumventing certain safety checks—creating complex and unprecedented risks.
assistant = entities capable of performing tasks for users. assistants operate based on the instructions in a context window + tools https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/assistants
attacks -- jailbreaks -- Constitutional Classifiers = safeguards that monitor model inputs and outputs to detect and block potentially harmful content. The novel aspect of the approach was that the classifiers were trained on synthetic data generated from a "constitution,” which included natural language rules specifying what’s allowed and what isn’t. For example, Claude should help with college chemistry homework, but not assist in the synthesis of Schedule 1 chemicals. https://www.anthropic.com/research/next-generation-constitutional-classifiers https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-classifiers
attacks -- jailbreaks -- universal = consistent attack strategies that work across many queries https://www.anthropic.com/research/next-generation-constitutional-classifiers
attacks -- jailbreaks = techniques that can circumvent safety guardrails and elicit harmful information https://www.anthropic.com/research/next-generation-constitutional-classifiers
attacks -- Output obfuscation & = prompt models to disguise their outputs in ways that appear harmless if a classifier is only looking at a model’s output. For example, during adversarial testing, attackers successfully instructed models to substitute possibly dangerous chemical names with innocuous alternatives (like referring to reagents as "food flavorings") or used metaphors and riddles in which harmful concepts are mapped onto anodyne concepts.
attacks -- Reconstruction & = break up harmful information into segments that appear benign, then reassemble them. For example, an attacker might embed a harmful query as a series of functions scattered throughout a codebase, then instruct the model to extract and respond to the hidden message
attention
attention -- flash attention = ???
beliefs = judgments a model appears to be forming about a user during a conversation, ex. age, wealth, education level, gender https://slashdot.org/story/25/05/24/1946203/people-should-know-about-the-beliefs-llms-form-about-them-while-conversing

Representation Engineering = calculating a "control vector" that can be read from or added to model activations during inference to interpret or control the model's behavior https://vgel.me/posts/representation-engineering/
research directions -- honesty, chain-of-thought faithfulness, adversarial robustness, evals and testbeds...
research directions -- Interpretability: How can we understand model internals? And can we use this to e.g. build an AI lie detector?
research directions -- Scalable oversight: How can we use AI systems to assist humans in evaluating the outputs of other AI systems on complex tasks?
research directions -- Weak-to-strong generalization: Humans will be weak supervisors relative to superhuman models. Can we understand and control how strong models generalize from weak supervision?
