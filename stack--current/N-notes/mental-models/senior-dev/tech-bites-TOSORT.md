- small = easier to review, less conflicts
- clean separated commits = easier to review, easier to cherry-pick / move
- if comments:
  - rebasing = cleaner final result
  - adding commits = easier to see what was amended
- QA demo
- book a slot to unblock!
- a Reviewer has to Approve, Reject, Comment or Delegate. No bullshit.
- first, get an approval from an internal reviewer, ensure green builds, then add your Shepherd / external




    “Clean Craftsmanship”Medal by Robert C. Martin Code quality 

        Turned out to be EXCELLENT book. Definitely technical. Half of it forms the most comprehensive resource on TDD I’ve ever read. (I’m contemplating creating a separate category for Testing/TDD).

    “Fundamentals of Software Architecture” by Ford, Richards Software architecture 

        I think it’s a better, more useful, more comprehensive intro than Uncle Bob’s “Clean Architecture”. Does not have a ton of soul, but is not completely dry, either.

    “Effective TypeScript” by Dan Vanderkam TypeScript 

        Top 2, but still losses to “Programming TypeScript” IMHO, for most people.

    “You Don’t Know JS Yet” by @getify JavaScript

        Still reading this multi-book encyclopedia JavaScriptica grinning face with smiling eyes 

    “Revising Prose”Medal by Richard A. Lanham Writing

        Does one thing, and does it very well: improves your sentence structure.

    “Dichotomy of Leadership” by Jocko Willink Leadership 

        Standalone book, like the original “Extreme Ownership”, but adds more about balance & tradeoffs – and removes little, so you can read it as a standalone book.






monolith refactoring
1. Move code into a good module structure, unpicking code and dependencies along the way
1. Understand the domain and build good and scalable abstractions in the form of new APIs which are backed directly by the database (no managers, etc.)
1. Replace usage of the old mess with the new APIs, validate consistency, etc.

In the future I plan on avoiding these mistakes by asking myself two questions:
    Why am I doing this?
and then more importantly,
    What is the evidence that this actually needs to be done?

extensible
 The service worker was designed as part of the extensible web. The idea is that we, as browser developers, acknowledge that we are not better at web development than web developers. And as such, we shouldn't provide narrow high-level APIs that solve a particular problem using patterns we like, and instead give you access to the guts of the browser and let you do it how you want, in a way that works best for your users.
