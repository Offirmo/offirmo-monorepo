junior - navigate the corporate world = strips

"volume hiring" vs. stress + 1y to find a new job

Personal MBA

protect the discipline, don't work after hours

employable = have choice, can quit

hiring / economic cycles

when hunted, take the opportunity

https://www.teamblind.com/post/Made-it-to-FAANG-director-without-a-promotion-ever-HVX5th8f

I finally (recently) made it to FAANG Director without ever being promoted in my entire career.

Started as a new grad (out of grad school) 15 years ago.

Entire career was in big tech companies (including 3 ‚ÄúFAANG‚Äú companies).

Never stayed at a company longer than 3 years.

Never been promoted at any company.

Never worked more than 20 hours per week, if that, at any job, any time in the past 15 years (except the first 6 months 15 years ago <‚Äî a mistake).

How?

1. Always negotiated good, impactful work

2. but also push back and take up the bare minimum

3. Do a really good job at it

4. Market the heck out of the work that you do

5. Be super nice to people

6. Be extra nice with your manager

7. Flee (saying you are not a good fit) as soon as you know the manager is not amenable to such stuff

  7a. Flee could be an internal transfer, or external
  
  7b. Shortest tenure in a team was 2 months; I have changed teams internally  3 times (tenures of 2 months, 5 months, 7 months)

8. Consciously take up work that helps colleagues. I spend 3-4 hours every week helping colleagues.

9. Invest in upskilling. While I work only 20 hours I am a hard worker and have constantly invested in myself (leetcode back in the day, systems knowledge, books on management and leadership, providing talks at conferences and publishing. For
   Someone with just a Masters degree I have a decent publication record and am considered somewhat of an expert in my area).

Btw: I learnt all this from my first manager (RIP, he was from the Midwest, who would give me words of wisdom over beer üç∫ during lunch and I joined his team a year before his retirement)

Why I am posting this?

I see a lot of really stupid managers (micromanagers) who are hell-bent on ‚Äúextracting‚Äù the maximum work out of their reports, while working for multi-billion dollar monopolies.
It‚Äôs almost like these guys have no common sense and try to one up their peer Eng leaders.
Frequently they are not working on the most impactful work but do tedious stuff. Take it easy folks.
Focus on the value you provide but if you are providing a lot of value, make sure you extract some benefit for your teams.

New btw, is my own company that I use to manage my rental properties.

* demonstrable impact from main role
  * ex. dev = code, PRs, tickets implemented, features shipped, bugs fixed
* Engineering Excellence AKA ‚ÄúI do hard things‚Äù
  * Code reviews that I‚Äôve given that I‚Äôm proud of.
* Direction = Technical decisions and proposals
* Organizational Impact
  * interviews
  * mentoring


### evidences / data signals

## progression


> Promotion is this carrot that dangles in front of you. When you focus on it, you‚Äôd be miserable.
> Always focus on actual work and scope. You‚Äôd be rewarded by jumping ship sooner than the next promo lands.


P3 should be learning how to engineer high quality software
P4 should be doing the lion‚Äôs share of engineering
P5 should be leading your team‚Äôs execution on engineering
P6 should be driving action in your teams, after identifying opportunities themselves


## job change

### offboarding
* internal blog posts
* networking
* private files on own computers
* CV blurbs, incl. numbers!! 


### onboarding
* meet everyone
  * "what should I know?"
  * "who should I meet?"
