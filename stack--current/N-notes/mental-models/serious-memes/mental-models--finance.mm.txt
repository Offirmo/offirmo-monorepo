ETF "exchange-traded fund" = a type of fund that directly tracks the price of an underlying asset, such as a commodity or cryptocurrency, by holding it in reserve https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/what-is-ethereum-spot-etf/
ETF -- Futures & = futures ETFs rely on contracts that speculate on the asset's future price. This can lead to discrepancies between the price of the shares of a futures ETF and the current market price of the underlying asset. Futures ETFs can also exhibit phenomena like contango or backwardation, where prices deviate from spot market prices due to the structure of futures contracts.
ETF -- spot & = A fund manager purchases some amount of the asset, holds it in custody, and issues shares against it. Investors buy the shares, which represent fractional ownership of the fund's asset holdings. If the fund is managed effectively, the price of the shares should mirror the asset’s price on the spot market. This model lets investors gain exposure to the asset’s spot price without the complications of asset management, such as storage or security. Instead, they can simply buy and sell shares with a brokerage account.

poverty -- Sherman Alexie = It sucks to be poor, and it sucks to feel that you somehow deserve to be poor. You start believing that you're poor because you're stupid and ugly. And then you start believing that you're stupid and ugly because you're Indian. And because you're Indian you start believing you're destined to be poor. It's an ugly circle and there's nothing you can do about it. Poverty doesn't give you strength or teach you lessons about perseverance. No, poverty only teaches you how to be poor.
