5 Harsh Truths for Success from Linus Torvalds https://medium.com/codex/5-harsh-truths-from-linus-torvalds-406ab20cea02
5 mantras -- 1% better = You don’t need to change the world. Just make something — anything — 1% better, every day. Movement of the smallest rocks can cause the greatest landslides.
5 mantras -- Don’t get stuck = when I feel stuck it is because I am being too stubborn to change, too egotistical to ask for help, or too tired to invite creativity into my thinking. There is rarely no way out.
5 mantras -- Find joy in the journey = We give so much of our lives to our work, so we should put some effort into making it something that brings us joy. We probably find that joy in different places, but it’s important that we know what fuels us. Our work, and our lives, are better for it.
5 mantras -- Prototype the path = The only way through is to do. Hard problems get a hell of a lot easier when we get our hands dirty, equip our curiosity, and start trying things out.
5 mantras -- You are enough = I don’t tell myself this often enough. I’d dare to say that you don’t either. But it’s a mantra that I repeat to myself often.
5 mantras = by Christopher Davis (burnout)

look for Things That Don’t Make Sense: The world always makes sense. But it can be confusing. When it is, your model of the world is wrong. So, things that don’t make sense are a learning opportunity. Big opportunities won’t make sense until it’s too late to profit from them.

outside context problem (OCP) = a problem that is "outside the context" as it is generally not considered until it occurs, and the capacity to actually conceive of or consider the OCP in the first place may not be possible or very limited (i.e., the majority of the group's population may not have the knowledge or ability to realize that the OCP can arise, or assume it is extremely unlikely). An example of OCP is an event in which a civilization does not consider the possibility that a much more technologically advanced society can exist, and then encounters one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession#Outside_Context_Problem

Overton window: You can control thought without limiting speech. You can do it by defining the limits of acceptable thought while allowing for lively debate within these barriers. For example, Fox News and MSNBC set limits on what political thoughts they consider acceptable, but in the grand scheme of things, they’re both fairly conventional. The political spectrum stretches far beyond the ideas they entertain, but ideas outside their limits are shunned.

paradox of Abundance: The average quality of information is getting worse and worse. But the best stuff is getting better and better. Markets of abundance are simultaneously bad for the median consumer but good for conscious consumers.
paradox of Consensus: Under ancient Jewish law, if a suspect was found guilty by every judge, they were deemed innocent. Too much agreement implied a systemic error in the judicial process. Unanimous agreement sometimes leads to bad decisions.
paradox of Specificity: Focus isn’t as constraining as it seems. In the age of the Internet, when everybody has Google search and personalized social media feeds, differentiation is free marketing. The more specific your goal, the more opportunities you’ll create for yourself. Narrowing your aperture can expand your horizons.

Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 01 = thinking we are “immortal”, “immune” or downright “indispensable”, neglecting the need for regular check-ups. One who is not self-critical, which does not seek to be more fit, is a sick body
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 02 = “Martha complex”, excessive busy-ness. It is found in those who immerse themselves in work and inevitably neglect “the better part”: sitting at the feet of Jesus
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 03 = mental and spiritual “petrification”. It is found in those who have a heart of stone, the “stiff-necked” (Acts 7:51-60), in those who in the course of time lose their interior serenity, alertness and daring, and hide under a pile of papers
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 04 = excessive planning and of functionalism
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 05 = poor coordination. Once its members lose communion among themselves, the body loses its harmonious functioning and its equilibrium
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 06 = “spiritual Alzheimer’s disease”. It consists in losing the memory of our personal “salvation history”, our past history with the Lord and our “first love”
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 07 = rivalry and vainglory.[11] When appearances, the colour of our clothes and our titles of honour become the primary object in life
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 08 = existential schizophrenia. This is the disease of those who live a double life, the fruit of that hypocrisy typical of the mediocre and of a progressive spiritual emptiness which no doctorates or academic titles can fill. It is a disease which often strikes those who abandon pastoral service and restrict themselves to bureaucratic matters, thus losing contact with reality, with concrete people
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 09 = gossiping, grumbling and back-biting. I have already spoken many times about this disease, but never enough. It is a grave illness which begins simply, perhaps even in small talk, and takes over a person, making him become a “sower of weeds”
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 10 = idolizing superiors. This is the disease of those who court their superiors in the hope of gaining their favour. They are victims of careerism and opportunism; they honour persons and not God
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 11 = indifference to others. This is where each individual thinks only of himself and loses sincerity and warmth of human relationships
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 12 = lugubrious face. Those glum and dour persons who think that to be serious we have to put on a face of melancholy and severity, and treat others – especially those we consider our inferiors – with rigour, brusqueness and arrogance
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 13 = hoarding. When an apostle tries to fill an existential void in his heart by accumulating material goods, not out of need but only in order to feel secure. The fact is that we are not able to bring material goods with us
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 14 = closed circles, where belonging to a clique becomes more powerful than belonging to the Body and, in some circumstances, to Christ himself. This disease too always begins with good intentions
Pope Francis 15 spiritual diseases -- 15 = disease of worldly profit, of forms of self-exhibition.[17] When an apostle turns his service into power, and his power into a commodity in order to gain worldly profit or even greater power

regrets -- guiding toward less-regrettable courses of action
regrets -- inaction over action -- 1 = because we can undo an action’s consequences. Although one cannot take back a disastrous action or hurtful comment, restitutions and apologies can diminish the intensity of regret. In contrast, “undoing” a failure to act is often impossible. The one who got away may now be married to someone else; some talents can only be fully developed if one starts young; a once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity comes around only once. Even when ameliorative action is possible, people find it difficult to overcome the inertia inherent in one’s earlier inaction
regrets -- inaction over action -- 2 = people are typically better able to rationalize their mistakes of action than their mistakes of inaction. It is generally easier for people to identify a silver lining in their regrettable actions by focusing on important lessons learned, new relationships forged, and new doors opened. Not acting, or acting the same as one always has, rarely provides the same sort of compensatory benefits
regrets -- inaction over action -- 3 = inactions tend to be seen as less justified in retrospect. Although the reasons that prevent people from acting are compelling at the time, they are often experienced as less so down the road. A contemporaneous fear of failure, for example, often gives way to more confident retrospective evaluations of one’s likelihood of success
regrets -- inaction over action -- 4 = people tend to remember their unrealized goals better than those that have been fulfilled and many regrets of inaction are exactly that—unfulfilled goals. People are therefore more likely to call to mind and be bothered by their regrets of inaction than their regrets of action
regrets -- inaction over action -- BUT "best time to plant a tree..."
regrets -- inaction over action = ppl regret more things they didn’t do and wish they had done rather than things they did and wish they hadn’t

ring theory -- 01 The person in the center ring can say anything she wants to anyone, anywhere. She can kvetch and complain and whine and moan and curse the heavens and say, "Life is unfair," and, "Why me?" That's the one payoff for being in the center ring. Everyone else can say those things too, but only to people in larger rings.
ring theory -- 02 When you are talking to a person in a ring smaller than yours, someone closer to the center of the crisis, the goal is to help. Listening is often more helpful than talking. But if you're going to open your mouth, first ask yourself if what you are about to say is likely to provide comfort and support. If it isn't, don't say it. Don't, for example, give advice. People who are suffering from trauma don't need advice. They need comfort and support. So say, "I'm sorry," or, "This must really be hard for you," or, "Can I bring you a pot roast?" Don't say, "You should hear what happened to me," or, "Here's what I would do if I were you." And don't say, "This is really bringing me down."

selectorate theory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectorate_theory
self -- 3 selves = ideal, actual/real, ought = A grasp of these three elements and the discrepancies between them provides a roadmap to understanding the individual’s sense of self and her characteristic emotions and patterns of behavior.
self -- actual/real = representation of the attributes she (or others) believes she possesses
self -- discrepancy -- ideal = causes dejection-related emotions such as sadness and disappointment
self -- discrepancy -- ideal = promotion-focused
self -- discrepancy -- ideal = the most important on dying
self -- discrepancy -- ought = causes agitation-related emotions such as fear, guilt, and restlessness
self -- discrepancy -- ought = prevention-focused
self -- discrepancy -- ought vs ideal = immediate guilt, anxiety, and agitation that come from failures to live up to one’s duties and responsibilities are “hot” emotions that beg for quick resolution vs the slowly accumulating disappointment, discouragement, and dejection that come from failures to live up to one’s goals and aspirations are less likely to elicit the same immediate reactions. People may sometimes feel the urge to resolve their ideal-related regrets, but these typically take a backseat to more urgent and pressing ought-related regrets.2 As a result, although the initial sting of ought-related regrets may be more intense, ideal-related regrets may prove more bothersome—and more enduring in the long run
self -- discrepancy = gaps between how an individual perceives her actual self and her ideal and ought selves lead to predictable patterns of negative emotions
self -- ideal = individual’s dreams and aspirations, or the constellation of skills, traits, and resources that an individual ideally wishes to acquire
self -- ideal = representation of the attributes she (or others) would ideally like to possess (e.g., her hopes, goals, aspirations, or wishes
self -- ought = representation of the attributes she (or others) believes she should possess (e.g., her duties, obligations, and responsibilities)
