As we discussed at parent/teacher, please see below some fun and simple ideas you might like to try at home to strengthen XXX's phonological and phonemic awareness (his ability to manipulate spoken sounds).
I Spy (sounds not letter names) e.g. "I spy with my little eye something sounding with the sound /b/". You can do the same with blending e.g. "I spy a b / r / ow / n d / o / g"
Sound scavenger hunt: Choose a letter sound and ask XXX to find things around the house that start with that sound, e.g. /p/ - pencil, pot, pan, pillow etc.
Simon Says e.g. "Simon says put your hands on your h / ea / d". "Simon says put your hands on your ch / ee / k / s".
Using toys or objects - ask in sounds to find the object you've asked for e.g "Can you please find me the r / e / d c / a / r".
Snail Talk - tell XXX you will communicate in "snail talk" and he needs to figure out what you're saying. Stretch out a simple word e.g. 'dddddoooooggg', then ask XXX to tell you the word. Switch roles and have him stretch a word for you.
Sound Counting - Using Lego or similar, say a word slowly and ask XXX to repeat the word. Have him tell you how many sounds the word makes, e.g. top - /t/ /o/ /p/ - three sounds, so place three lego pieces in a row or in each cell of an 'elkonin box' (see attached). Then have XXX tap each lego piece as he says the sound.
Tongue Ticklers: Make up some funny alliterative sentences and take turns identifying the repeating initial sound, e.g. "Sally the snake sings songs about socks and strawberries"
Talk about words that start or end with the sound as other familiar words, e.g. "The word cat ends in /t/? What else ends in /t/? Plate, let etc. Talk about how the start/end sounds of the words are alike. You can do the same with other words and names - Mum, Dad etc.
Play with magnetic letters or big letters cut from a magazine - put them together to blend simple three-letter words.
