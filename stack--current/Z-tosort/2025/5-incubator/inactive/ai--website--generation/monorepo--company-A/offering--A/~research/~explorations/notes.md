Oh yes, I do! The Hamster Dance was a major web phenomenon in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It's considered one of the earliest viral "memes" and a pioneer in the era of internet-based entertainment.

The craze began in 1998 when Canadian art student Deidre LaCarte created a web page called "Hampton's Hamster House" on Geocities. The site featured rows of animated GIFs of various hamsters and other rodents dancing to a sped-up version of the song "Whistle Stop" from the Disney movie Robin Hood.

It was simple, catchy, and incredibly addictive. People loved watching the pixelated hamsters groove, and the site quickly spread by word-of-mouth and email chains. At its peak, millions of people visited Hampton's Hamster House, making it one of the most popular websites in the world.

The Hamster Dance's success spawned countless imitations and parodies, further cementing its status as a cultural phenomenon. It even went beyond the internet, with merchandise, music releases, and even a TV show based on the dancing hamsters.

While the original site is no longer online, the spirit of the Hamster Dance lives on. It's a reminder of the power of the internet to create and share joy, and a testament to the enduring appeal of cute, dancing animals. So next time you're feeling nostalgic for the early days of the internet, crank up that sped-up "Whistle Stop" and let the dancing hamsters whisk you back in time!
