	// NOTES:
	// - the whole point of an action is to change the state of the system, so we should assume a representation update will be needed (or else why not a link?)
	// - we must assume the response can be lost, thus if critical we must store the "result story" as pending engagements
	//   ex. a game where an action triggers an important cutscene:
	//   - in case of crash/disconnection and the player lose a very important story development. (happened to me in Ultima IX with crashing vids btw)
	//   = we must ensure it has been seen/processed by the player


	// TODO 1D push = server-initiated updates (bg sync, collab, multi-tabs...)
	// ping a browser? a URL?
