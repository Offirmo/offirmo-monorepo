# New improved Hypermedia

## Introduction
Goal:
* new Hypermedia format to be used as "representation" for **true** REST / HATEOAS architecture
  * HATEOAS = Hypermedia as the ?? 
  * would need a new kind of browser, of course
* higher level
* AI compatible = text/markdown compatible + "context"-compatible (summary)
* chat-like interface compatible
  * by extension terminal compatible
  * great for accessibility!
* ideally striving back to a thinner client
  * yet supporting progressive enhancement / fat client



## concepts

1. Hypertext = text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext
   * Apart from text, the term "hypertext" is also sometimes used to describe tables, images, and other presentational content formats with integrated hyperlinks
   * hypertext enables the easy-to-use publication of information over the Internet
2. Hyperlink = digital reference providing direct access to data by a user's clicking or tapping https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink
3. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
   * needs a client = the web browser
   * "Fatal Flaw of HTML" = The harsh reality is that HTML never got to the point that it could, by itself, offer UX approaching the thick client. Pure server-side rendered HTML offered only a simple & clunky Click → Request → Page Render model
4. Hypermedia = an extension of hypertext, is a nonlinear medium of information that includes graphics, audio, video, plain text and hyperlinks
   - Hypermedia-Driven Application Architecture https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-driven-applications/
   - needs a client = the web browser
   - Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) = a client interacts with a network application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia. A REST client needs little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with an application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/
5. Hyperview = further extension where the UI itself "supports common UI elements like headers, scroll views, lists, text field, and much more" is encoded https://hyperview.org/docs/guide_introduction  
6. Representational State = representation of a resource containing hypermedia links that can be followed to make the state of the system change. Any such request will in turn receive the representation of a resource, and so on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm 6.2.1
   - the only identifier that needs to be known is the identifier of the first resource requested, and all other identifiers will be discovered
7. Representational State Transfer (REST) = set of constraints for how the architecture of a distributed, Internet-scale hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST
   - stateless, cacheable, uniform interface
   - mismatches, ex. HTTP cookies violate REST constraints because they can become out of sync with the browser's application state https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm
   - Richardson Maturity Model 0,1,2,3 https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html

Spectrums:
- hypertext -> hypermedia -> hyperview
- MPA -> HDA <- SPA https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-driven-applications/#genesis

thin/thick client + thick/thin servers but also now edge!

### existing

* HTML
  * is "screen only", a screen replaces the previous screen on navigation
  * can use frames, but frames have perf issues
  * led to the emergence of SPAs "sad state of web development" https://htmx.org/essays/a-response-to-rich-harris/
* HTML+htmx slightly improves on that
* HXML https://hyperview.org/docs/guide_html


## Spec

We want more.

See all the essays in https://htmx.org/essays/

Warning: avoid inner platform effect!!!


* new Hypermedia format to be used as "representation" for **true** REST / HATEOAS architecture
  * would need a new kind of browser, of course
  * HATEOAS: avoid state as much as possible at all level, try to help the layer above to avoid state
* should be generic to be used in both terminal, chat-like interface, web app, mobile app…
* JSON based (obviously)
* would always have a text representation
  * with optional enrichments as supported by the "browser", but would have a fallback representation
    * illustrations
    * bg picture
      * landscape
    * soundscape
    * ...
* auto-reloads should not end in failures = broken pages
* keep the semantic!
* mutations not limited to PUT/POST/DELETE, also RPC/action
  * not restricted to <a> & <form>
* optionally code-on-demand? (lazy loading?)
* would not need a full screen refresh (the case for SPA)
  * tabs? trees? tables?
  * frames/widgets?
  * tooltips? ("floating UI" https://floating-ui.com/)
* support other "streams" of representation: (TBD!)
  * flow, // normal immediate feedback to user actions
  * vs. floating = not disrupting the flow
  * popup // full screen ? sub-container?
  * flyout
  * popover
  * announcement
  * cutscene
  * skippable
  * possibility of aborting? (difficult)
  semantic_level?: 'error' | 'warning' | 'info' | 'success',
  * auto-dismiss?
  * ...
* push from server (the other missing case from PWA/traditional html)
* rsrc + pending engagements
* offline first
* progressive enhancement
* improved concept of "session"
  * not tied to tab life
    * bc for ex. if tab left for a long time, may be considered a new session
    * also bc we want to embrace "multi tab" work = no need to have several recaps or notifs
  * also concept of recap
* ideally should embed the concept of notifications as well
* support preview = highly simplified summary of a rsrc
* should be designed to be composable, with different teams working on different rsrc
  * ex. no "overall hints" at the root, should be discoverable along the way
* And don't forget!
  * cool!
  * whimsical!


recommended design?
chain of resources with "continueᝍto" or actions/engagements?
ex. TBRPG's play = action/engagement? or /aventure -> /adventure/last -> adventures?
-> rsrc when we may want to go back to it (ex last adventure's result)
-> engagement when disposable + we don't want to have it again if revisiting the rsrc
