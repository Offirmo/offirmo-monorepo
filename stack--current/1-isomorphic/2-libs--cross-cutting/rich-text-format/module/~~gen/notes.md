## Intro

A new rich text format designed for programmatic generation, transfer and rendering.

Goals:
- be isomorphic
  - = can be rendered everywhere
    - sheet of paper
    - pure text (fixed width or not), markdown...
    - Terminal (escape codes, images, ascii art...)
    - Web: Html, React... (interactive or not)
    - Twitter, Instagram
    - ...
- be semantic
  - = helps isomorphic-ness by leaving as many decisions as possible to the renderer,
    depending on the capabilities of the target medium
- being able to be serialized and transferred across protocols
  - JSON
- being usable as a Hypermedia representation for true REST
- having a natural structure making sense when inspected as raw JSON
- challenge JSON, Markdown, HTML in some aspects

This format is half-way between raw text and HTML, a bit similar to Markdown.

Differences with other document formats ()
- vs. Atlassian, Slack...
  - we don't systematically have an array of children
    Instead, when applicable, a text with references to other nodes is used. Advantages:
    - a bit more readable
    - we can re-use nodes
    - we can over-supply nodes and not always use them
    Arrays are still allowed to express semantic constructs like lists, tables, header>content<footer,
    but should be avoided if not necessary.
- vs. Html
  - we aim at true REST HATEOAS
- vs. Markdown

## Concepts

- inline vs block https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9189810/css-display-inline-vs-inline-block
- sectioning
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#sectioning_content
- header/heading https://egyetemi.anglofon.hu/blog/difference-between-heading-and-header/
  > Header is a general description of the document which is displayed at the top of every page.
  > For example, most word processor software contain a special feature for inserting text that would appear on every page.
  > The same applies to the footer, which is displayed at the bottom of every page, along with the page numbering.
  >
  > Heading is the word or phrase that or sentence that explains what the following part is about.
  > It is written at the beginning of a structural part, therefore, it is considered a structural element of a document.
  > It clearly indicates the content of the following section.
  >
  > In legal writing, heading is an important means of arranging the content.
  > Contracts, for example, are divided into various structural parts, such as articles, sections and clauses.
  > However, contracts very often spell out that headings and titles are not included in the interpretation of the contract,
  > but they are used for explanatory purposes, at often worded they are used for "convenience of reference".

- Front Matter
  - https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/using-yaml-frontmatter
  - not needed in our case since we're not a text format and have extensible hints

## TODO

TODO escaping (mitigated for now with a rare codepoint)
- not a bad idea, though.
- could use more: https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/block/U+2300

TODO license
TODO credits

TODO i18n
- TODO should it be first class citizen or an extension? or before/after?
- TODO beware of still allowing message extraction tools
- TODO custom date and number formatting
- TODO ICU message format?

TODO a11y
- similar to HTML?

TODO @mentions ?

TODO #hashtags ?

TODO some AI stuff?
TODO some web3 stuff?

## tosort

It has only 1 dimension (flow) but hints can be added to render in a more fancy way if supported. Ex. a "ul/ol" hint.

TODO one day add a linting feature:
- lint types etc.
