# Engagement

// IMPORTANT NOTE: the consumer is free to interpret this as they want.
// For ex. a "full flow" consumer such as a terminal-based app would likely display everything as flow anyway

## Concepts
- Engagement = any sort of attention-grabbing message
- client type:
  - full flow such as: terminal, chat interface
  - complex app
- level: log / notice / warning / critical
- CONTENT flow vs float
  - flow = in the same flow as one's actions, usually immediate BUT not necessarily important, ex. "level up" animation = in-flow but could be ignored
    - NOTE that action's feedback (ack, result) doesn't have to be in flow, ex. confirmation toast 
    - acknowledgement of request
    - form / input (incl. confirmation requests)
    - progress bar, illusion of labor
    - answer, result (or error), acknowledgement
    - cutscene (interactive)
    - transition
    - tutorial?
  - float = float above the UI and doesn't have to interrupt the CONTENT flow
    - announcement banner (ex. maintenance)
    - upgrade notice
    - hint of the day
- main vs aside
  - aside = side message like an achievement
- auto-dismiss

## Known use cases

progress with minimal duration          yes
Growth prompt                           no
Welcome message                         no
tip of the day                          no
tip for current flow ex. play           yes
warning relevant to current flow        yes   ex. "inventory full"
success/failure of a code redemption    yes
achievement-unlocked                    yes
"app ugraded"                           no
cutscene                                yes   ex. hyperspace jump, landing...

## TOSORT

| `flow--${string}` // ex. cutscene, transition, loading bar, special effect...
| `float--${string}` // ex. announcement banner, "tip of the day"...
