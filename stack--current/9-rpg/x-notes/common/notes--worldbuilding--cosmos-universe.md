## top (unknown)

unknown. as far as we know, we could be in an unknown tree of simulations, bubbles, planes, multiverse branches, etc.

## God scale

We could be considered inside a "created universe" ref. to God's creation, which could have many other "planes of existence" with different laws of physics


## simulation scale

We can also be considered inside a simulation, which would have a purpose:
* experimentation: of alternate cosmic development / life / civilization
* protection: from more advanced civ, which would turn us into "3rd world" and also kill motivation (step too high)
* protection: from ourselves = great filters, could also protect our planet against self-destruction
* entertainment: for a more advanced civ, able to watch us

## N+1 scale = beyond universe

some theories are our current "universe" could be the inside of a black hole https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockwave_cosmology

or a bubble

## cosmic scale = universe

"truly cosmic" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#Cosmic_origin

~13B yo universe from a Big Bang


## observable universe
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe

restricted by the speed of light = areas we'll never see or reach




## galactic scale



## star system scale



## planet scale
