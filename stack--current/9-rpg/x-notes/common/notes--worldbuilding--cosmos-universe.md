## concepts
- universe = all of space and time and their contents. It comprises:
  - all of existence
  - any fundamental interaction, physical process and physical constant
  - therefore all forms of matter and energy and the structures they form, from sub-atomic particles to entire galactic filaments 
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe
- each level is "containing" the below as of "Hill sphere"
- object vs structure
- dimensions = we know 4 but could have more


## top = God scale

At some point, there is an eternal "top" level, which is the "God scale"
We could be considered inside a "created universe" ref. to God's creation, which could have many other "planes of existence" with different laws of physics

"soul" would be the anchor point to the top-level = unique reference to a sentient individual


## N+1 scale = above current universe
unknown. as far as we know, we could be in an unknown tree of simulations, bubbles, planes, multiverse branches, etc.

### multiverse
- multiverse = hypothetical set of all universes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse
- Convenient for scenarios, but better not abuse
- also can be kept to explain "savegames"

### simulation

We can also be considered inside a simulation, which would have a purpose:
* experimentation: of alternate cosmic development / life / civilization
* protection: from more advanced civ, which would turn us into "3rd world" and also kill motivation (step too high)
* protection: from ourselves = great filters, could also protect our planet against self-destruction
* entertainment: for a more advanced civ, able to watch us

### bubble/pocket universe inside a wider universe

some theories are our current "universe" could be
* the inside of a black hole https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockwave_cosmology
* or any sort of bubble/marble


## cosmic scale = universe (space-time universe)

* "truly cosmic" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#Cosmic_origin
* shape https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe
* age https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe ~13B yo universe from a Big Bang


## observable universe
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe

restricted by the speed of light = areas we'll never see or reach

## galactic scale

* # of galaxies https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/830/2/83


## star system scale



## planet scale


## misc

sphere of influence of an object https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere
= we're always in the sphere of influence of an object
