Warships https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship
* carrier
* assault ship
* cruiser = largest ships in a fleet https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser
  * independent warship. "Cruiser" meant the purpose or mission of a ship, rather than a category of vessel.
  * the term was nonetheless used to mean a smaller, faster warship suitable for such a role
    * vs too large, inflexible, and expensive to be dispatched on long-range missions and too strategically important to be put at risk of fouling and foundering by continual patrol duties 
  * --protected https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_cruiser
  * --armored https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_cruiser
  * --battle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlecruiser with battleship-level armament and cruiser-level armour; typically faster than a battleship because the reduction in armour allowed mounting of more powerful propulsion machinery, or the use of a more slender hull shape with a lower drag coefficient.
  * --aircraft https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_cruiser
  * --torpedo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo_cruiser
  * --scout https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_cruiser
* escort https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_escort
* frigate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigate
  * built for speed and maneuverability, intended to be used in scouting, escort and patrol roles
  * Able to carry six months' stores, had very long range
  * vessels larger than frigates were considered too valuable to operate independently.
  * Frigates often saw action, which meant a greater chance of glory, promotion, and prize money
  * often the vessel of choice in historical naval novels due to their relative freedom compared to ships-of-the-line (kept for fleet actions) and smaller vessels (generally assigned to a home port and less widely ranging)
  * --heavy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_cruiser
  * --super heavy
  * --light https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cruiser
  * --armoured
  * --first class / second class
* corvette https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvette
  * traditionally the smallest class of vessel considered to be a proper (or "rated") warship. The warship class above the corvette is that of the frigate, while the class below was historically that of the sloop-of-war
* dreadnought https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreadnought
  * wo revolutionary features: an "all-big-gun" armament scheme, with an unprecedented number of heavy-calibre guns, and steam turbine propulsion
  * --super
* destroyer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer
  * fast and highly maneuverable warship, traditionally incapable of independent action. Originally developed to counter the threat of torpedo boats, they are now the largest independent warship generally seen on the ocean
  * fast, maneuverable, long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy, or carrier battle group and defend them against a wide range of general threats
  * --leader https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer_leader
* Littoral combat ship (LCS)
* gunboat https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunboat
  * designed for the express purpose of carrying one or more guns to bombard coastal targets, as opposed to those military craft designed for naval warfare, or for ferrying troops or supplies
* sloop of war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloop-of-war
