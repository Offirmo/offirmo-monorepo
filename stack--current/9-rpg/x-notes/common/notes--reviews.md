"Not to capture the reality of aerial combat, but to understand the fantasy of it."
Genius dude, I literally could not have put it better myself. Ace Combat isn't about simulating real-world combat scenarios, what Ace Combat does is make you remember what it felt like running around with your toy planes in the back yard, and bringing THOSE scenarios to life.
One of my earliest memories, at age 4, was me sitting in the livingroom with my dad and eating my supper and watching him play Air Combat. After he finished a mission, he passed me the controller and said "Want to try?" and I played a mission and I was hooked from then on. I still remember how he explained how to play and how to shoot down enemy planes. He's gone now, but even though he's gone, Ace Combat is still here, so he sorta is too. I grew up with this franchise, and I fully intend to pass it onto my children. I'm gonna make playing Ace Combat a family tradition.

Anyway, that's what I've come to believe, and I think that's enough.
