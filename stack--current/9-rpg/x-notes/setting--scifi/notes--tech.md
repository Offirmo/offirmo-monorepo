> an unrestricted FTL technology would give no limits to what heroes and villains could do.
> Limiting the places a ship can appear in, or making them more predictable,
> means that they will meet each other most often around contested planets or space stations,
> allowing for narratively satisfying battles or other encounters.
> On the other hand, a less restricted hyperdrive may also allow for dramatic escapes
> as the pilot "jumps" to hyperspace in the midst of battle to avoid destruction

> we had to provide some loophole for various powerful aliens like Q,

> This lets Q and his friends have fun in the 9.9999+ range,
> but also lets our ship travel slowly enough to keep the galaxy a big place,
