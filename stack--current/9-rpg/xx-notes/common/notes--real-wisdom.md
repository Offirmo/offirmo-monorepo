creative “Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.” https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish

Violations of human dignity:

The list of violations
The Declaration then presents the list of "some grave violations of human dignity".
This includes "all offences against life itself, such as murder, genocide, abortion,
euthanasia, and willful suicide” must be recognized as contrary to human dignity ", but also
"all violations of the integrity of the human person, such as mutilation, physical and mental
torture, undue psychological pressures ".
And, finally, it includes "all offences against human
dignity, such as subhuman living conditions,
arbitrary imprisonment, deportation, slavery,
prostitution, the selling of women and children,
degrading working conditions where individuals are
treated as mere tools for profit rather than free and
responsible persons".
The death penalty is also cited, since it "violates the inalienable dignity of every person,
regardless of the circumstances" (34).

Poverty, war and human trafficking
The first issue mentioned is poverty, "one of the greatest injustices in the contemporary
world" (36).
Then there is war, "another tragedy that denies human dignity", and always a “defeat of
humanity" (38), to the point that "it is very difficult nowadays to invoke the rational criteria
elaborated in earlier centuries to speak of the possibility of a ‘just war.’"(39).
The Declaration also discusses the "travail of migrants", whose "lives are put at risk
because they no longer have the means to start a family, to work, or to feed themselves"
(40).
The document then dwells on "human trafficking", which is taking on "tragic dimensions"
and is described as " vile activity, a disgrace to our societies that claim to be civilized ". The
Declaration invites "exploiters and clients" to make a serious examination of conscience
(41).
Similarly, it calls for the fight against phenomena such as “the marketing of human organs
and tissues, the sexual exploitation of boys and girls, slave labour, including prostitution,
the drug and weapons trade, terrorism, and international organized crime” (42).
The document also mentions sexual abuse, which leaves “deep scars in the hearts of those
who suffer it”: these are “sufferings that can last a lifetime and that no repentance can
remedy” (43).
Discrimination and violence against women are then discussed. Among the latter are listed
"coercive abortions, which affect both mother and child, often to satisfy the selfishness of
males" and "the practice of polygamy" (45). Femicide is also condemned (46).
Abortion and surrogacy
The condemnation of abortion is strong: "Among all the crimes which can be committed
against life, procured abortion has characteristics making it particularly serious and
deplorable", and reference is made to the fact that "defence of unborn life is closely linked
to the defence of each and every other human right" (47).
The Declaration’s rejection of surrogacy, by means of which "the immensely worthy child
becomes a mere object", is also strong. This is a practice that "represents a grave violation
of the dignity of the woman and the child ... A child is always a gift and never the basis of a
commercial contract.” (48)
The list goes on to mention euthanasia and assisted suicide, confusingly defined by some
laws as " death with dignity". The document stresses that "suffering does not cause the sick
to lose their dignity, which is intrinsically and inalienably their own" (51).
The Declaration then speaks of the importance of palliative care and the avoidance of
“aggressive treatments or disproportionate medical procedures”, reaffirming that “Life is a
right, not death, which must be welcomed, not administered” (52).
A further serious violation of human dignity is the marginalization of differently-abled
persons (53).
Gender theory
The document begins the section on this topic by stressing that "every sign of unjust
discrimination” against homosexual persons “is to be carefully avoided, particularly any
form of aggression and violence".

It is “contrary to human dignity", the Declaration says, that in some places “not a few people
are “imprisoned, tortured and even deprived of the good of life solely because of their
sexual orientation" (55).
Gender theory, which is “extremely dangerous since it cancels differences in its claim to
make everyone equal", is then criticised (56).
The Church, we read, recalls that "human life in all its dimensions, both physical and
spiritual, is a gift from God. This gift is to be accepted with gratitude and placed at the
service of the good. Desiring a personal self-determination, as gender theory prescribes ...
amounts to a concession to the age-old temptation to make oneself God" (57).
Gender theory "intends to deny the greatest possible difference that exists between living
beings: sexual difference” (58).
Therefore, " all attempts to obscure reference to the ineliminable sexual difference between
man and woman” are “to be rejected" (59).
Sex change is also judged negatively since it "risks threatening the unique dignity the
person has received from the moment of conception". This does not mean, however,
excluding the possibility that “a person with genital abnormalities that are already evident at
birth or that develop later may choose to receive the assistance of healthcare professionals
to resolve these abnormalities" (60).
Digital violence
The final item on the list is “digital violence”. “New forms of violence are spreading through
social media”, we read, such as cyberbullying, and “the internet is also a channel for
spreading pornography and the exploitation of persons for sexual purposes or through
gambling” (61).
The Declaration ends by urging that “respect for the dignity of the human person beyond all
circumstances be placed at the centre of the commitment to the common good and at the
centre of every legal system” (64).
