Vassal (State): While such a state may have a ruler, that ruler pays tribute to another state or nation. This was the situation in England before finally being united in 1066. This is also the definition of serfdom.

Client State: In this case, the state exists but another Nation State rules it in all but name. Italy was in such a position until its successful revolt in the 1860’s

Puppet (State): This can either refer to a leader under full control of another leader or a state under full control of another state. The control is hidden or behind the scenes. Vichy France and Manchukuo are examples of Puppet States while the leader in the Ukraine in 2014 was a puppet of Russia.

Protectorate: One of several ways to designate a colony. Rhodesia was a protectorate of the UK while much of central Africa were protectorates of France. In this case, the colonizing entity has full control of the Nation State

Satellite (State): In this case, the satellites are separate nation states but they espouse the same method of governance as the one controlling them. Eastern Europe was in such a situation before the USSR collapsed.
