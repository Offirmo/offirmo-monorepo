# JS modules export and transpilation policy

## Policy

The public modules in this monorepo ase exposed as:
- Latest stable ES, with latest stable module exports
  - with sometimes a few stage 4 features when they are already widely supported https://github.com/tc39/ecma262
  - instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) and [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/esm-node.html)
- as a convenience, pre-built CJS for latest ES (https://node.green/)
  supported by the oldest active LTS node (https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases or https://github.com/nodejs/Release)
- for modules in Typescript, trying to use the latest Typescript, best effort.
- while webpack is not used in this repo(*), we acknowledge that it's widely used and thus aim to support its latest version

See below more exact numbers.

Note: I do NOT agree with the opinion "don't transpile node_modules", see [issue]()


## Technical details

2. ECMASCript version
* latest ES = [ES2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript_version_history) + [latest spec](https://262.ecma-international.org/15.0/)
* latest ES reasonably supported by this node LTS (latest minor) = [ES2024](https://node.green/#ES2024) (incomplete but close enough though)

â­† latest convenient ES = 2023 (if changed, need search&replace in package.json, search for "es2023" and "update marker")

3. ES module
- we consider webpack outdated and are no longer taking into account its limitations
- we consider the ecosystem advanced enough to move to full ESM https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c#how-can-i-move-my-commonjs-project-to-esm

## Maintainer playbook
* when updating this file, also update `0-scripts/build-typescript.js`
* when updating node/lib, also update
  * `.nvmrc`
  * `engines` from root `package.json` = `"node":`
  * `"@types/node"`
  * `tsconfig.json`: `"lib":`
  * replace in `package.json`: `src.es202x`
  * `B-apps--support/online-adventur.es/heroku/.babelrc`
  * `B-apps--support/online-adventur.es/functions/.babelrc`
  * Netlify:
    * ensure AWS_LAMBDA_JS_RUNTIME = "nodejsXX.x" is valid in `netlify.toml`
    * in admin change AWS_LAMBDA_JS_RUNTIME = nodeXX.x or sth
  * sibling repos
    * adjust `.nvmrc` and `netlify.toml` in online-adventures.github.io




## TODO
- TODO are refreshes major or minor?? Most likely major (see @sindre)
- clarify not restricting node engine
