## Introduction

Welcome to this repo, thanks for browsing! (and maybe contributing?)

This monorepo aggregates most of my (Offirmo) personal projects, including:
* npm modules
* node tools
* web apps
* mobile apps
* dev tools
* ...

This is pure **HOBBY** development, for recharging.

I code **however I want**, often departing from old conventions.

I don't plan to sell/incorporate anything, enough stress in my life already, thank you!

This code is multi-licensed with extremely permissive terms. Pick what you want!
