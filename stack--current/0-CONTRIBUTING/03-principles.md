## Principles

Unless it's more convenient for some reason, this repo strives to adhere to those principles:

* readability is the top desirable code property
  * ["Code for the human, not the computer"](https://read.engineerscodex.com/p/7-simple-habits-of-the-top-1-of-engineers)
  * TypeScript https://www.typescriptlang.org/
* fight complexity or at least encapsulate it (lol I'm not really following this)
* single source of truth
  * flux architecture
* problems broken down in manageable components = separation of concerns
* immutability if possible
* functional programming
* command / query separation
* compatible with event sourcing (for offline first with server replay when back online)
* mobile first
* offline first
* open source
  * give back with licenses such as UNLICENSE or CC
  * open source whenever possible
* use boring technologies. Examples:
  * (if possible) node LTS over latest
  * (if possible) npm over yarn
  * as few tools as possible
  * Postgres
* dev should be possible locally
  * avoid using cloud-only services
* ideally should even work by opening a local .html file
* avoid vendor lock-in
  * ex. auth, aws...
  * wrap commonly used modules into a thin, semantic layer
* ...
