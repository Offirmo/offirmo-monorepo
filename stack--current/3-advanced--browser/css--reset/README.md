## CSS reset

My own CSS reset. A true reset.

## Introduction

### What is a CSS reset?

From Eric Meyer https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
> The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.
> (...) Reset styles quite often appear in CSS frameworks...
>
> The reset styles (...) are intentionally very generic. There isn't any default color or background set for the body element, for example. (...)
>
> Goal: After including the appropriate stylesheet from this module,
> HTML pages using non-deprecated elements should look identical on every browser and form factor

**My own reflexions on top of the above:**
* a true reset should still be readable, it should display at least as well as the browser default stylesheet
* a true reset should NOT introduce opinionated styles
* we not only want the same display across browsers and os, we also want stability across time = different versions of browser
* technically we should provide 1 reset per browser, maybe per combination browser + os

### Why a new one?
2017 FYI resets history https://css-tricks.com/reboot-resets-reasoning/

Reviewing the well known CSS, it appears they are not pure CSS reset:
* [list of early reset](https://perishablepress.com/a-killer-collection-of-global-css-reset-styles/)
* 2007 [Eric Meyer's](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
  * not versioned/modularized (copy/paste on a web page)
  * not clearly commented (ex. mentions "older browsers")
  * goes beyond a reset by setting "recommended" styles
* [Richard Clark's](http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/)
  * (iteration of Eric Meyer's, same issues)
  * (TODO look at)
* [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)
  * removes all margins = bad display
  * still supports IE
* [Josh Comeau's custom CSS reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
  * not versioned/modularized (copy/paste on a blog post)
  * goes beyond a reset by "improving" styles
* [Josh Comeau's global styles](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/treasure-trove/010-global-styles)
  * later version of the previous one
* [piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/)
  * not versioned/modularized (copy/paste on a blog post)
  * goes beyond a reset with opiniated choices, ex. default list "style none"
* [a11y-css-reset](https://github.com/mike-engel/a11y-css-reset)
  * is not a reset, more like a "recommended"
* TODO https://github.com/jensimmons/cssremedy https://css-tricks.com/css-remedy/
* TODO https://css-tricks.com/should-css-override-default-styles/
* TODO https://css-tricks.com/notes-on-josh-comeaus-custom-css-reset/
* TODO https://css-tricks.com/reboot-resets-reasoning/
* TODO https://github.com/h5bp/main.css

What we want:
* ideally we want a pure reset bringing all browsers/os to the same common denominator
  WITHOUT introducing opinions or "recommended"
* we won't come up with new styles, we'll settle on the most rational from any of the big 3 browsers
* "sane defaults" should NOT be included, such recommended styles should be built upon the reset in a **separated** stylesheet
  * however this common denominator should display properly a semantic HTML (thus adding a few styles can be acceptable if not handled by the any default stylesheet)
* deprecated elements and browsers/os should no longer be included
* should be unit tested with visual regression

IMPORTANT NOTE
* since we may be using a foundation, this reset will only contain the needed stuff to correct ACTUAL USEFUL differences.
  * we don't aim at covering all the rare quirks

## Contributing

Please report display differences across browsers, if possible with a reproduction!

CSS
* use :root instead of html
* use logical properties https://adrianroselli.com/2019/11/css-logical-properties.html
* use the most appropriate unit https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/

## Notes

Ideas
* TODO one day check if one can use js to grab the default style from inside a browser?
* TODO https://web.dev/baseline
* TODO https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-more-modern-css-reset/
* TODO https://bedrocss.austingil.com/
