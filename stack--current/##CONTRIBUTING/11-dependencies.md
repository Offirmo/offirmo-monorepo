Principles:
* as few dependencies as we can + as few transitive deps as we can
* as isomorphic as possible
* ESM if possible
* from "safe" authors if possible, ex. sindre
* if commonly used, wrap foreign modules into a thin, semantic layer so that we can swap them
* run the candidates through https://bundlephobia.com/


Intentionally outdated dependencies:
- sharp: because fixed dep of parcelJS
- ~~(none at the moment ðŸ¥³)~~
