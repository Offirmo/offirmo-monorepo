## License

The general principle is that I want to give back,
and I welcome people reusing my code and creating jobs/value from it even without crediting me.

[`Unlicense`](https://unlicense.org/) is the license marked in package.json and the one most closely reflecting my intent. However, this license is rejected by some companies; hence I'm multi-licensing all the code marked as "unlicensed" into:
* Creative Commons Zero (CC0) License (Public Domain) as well
* MIT License as well

For your convenience.

* NOTE: If present, a specific file's or package's license overrides the default/root one! For example, some assets have their own license and some packages are forks retaining a specific license.
* NOTE: for my games/apps/tools, the code is free but not the *marketing efforts*, i.e., you are free to copy but must reasonably change the name if competing
* Also, I don't want my name to be used as an endorsement.

I'm not an expert in licenses, so I reserve the right to "fork" into any other kind of license, without removing what was already shared, of course.
