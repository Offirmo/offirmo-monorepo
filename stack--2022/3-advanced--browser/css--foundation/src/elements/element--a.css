/* Ideally we should keep the default blue color of links,
 * as it's widely recognized and trigger a "muscle memory"
 * https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/deep-dives/why-are-hyperlinks-blue/
 * FYI blue (not visited) = rgb(0, 0, 238)
 *     violet (visited)   = rgb(85, 26, 139)
 *
 * However links color is an ideal candidate for giving one's site identity.

If you are to change the link color, here are my lists of requirements for the perfect color when choosing a link color:
- Optimal text accessibility with the background color and surrounding text.
  Your design decisions shouldn’t be the reason a user can’t access content on a page.
- Interactive states should always be styled in your stylesheets.
  Examples include: touch, visited, hover, active and focus.
- Links and buttons should be large enough to tap or click.
  You can’t be sure how people are interacting with your content on devices
  by using styluses, fingers, mice or trackpads.
  It’s your job to make sure your links are easy to navigate and have enough space around them.
