	 * -  %       🙅 NO we don't want relative, we want absolutes
	 * -  vw,  vh 🙅 NO because of mobile iOs, this is the reason dv, sv and lv where created. full story: https://nicolas-hoizey.com/articles/2015/02/18/viewport-height-is-taller-than-the-visible-part-of-the-document-in-some-mobile-browsers/
	 * let's review the advance ones:
	 * - svw, svh 🙅 NO we want the FULL = biggest viewport possible, not the small one
	 * - dvw, dvh ❓ yes IN THEORY
	 *               👍 works in Safari mobile, UA stays visible = not perfect (we could use more screen) however there is no strange scroll ✅
	 *               👎 Does NOT but NOT when we pin the app to the home screen with no UA interface :-( (seen 2024/04 iOs 17.4.1 iPhone 14)
	 * - lvw, lvh ❓ no IN THEORY
	 *               👎 on Safari Mobile, this causes a scrollbar to appear on start when UA visible, then on scroll the UA disappear and we're left with a horrible state (seen 2024/04 iOs 17.4.1 iPhone 14) TODO could we recover from that with a programmatic scroll?
