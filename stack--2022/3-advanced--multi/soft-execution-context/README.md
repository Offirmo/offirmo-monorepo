# soft-execution-context

A fresh take on asynchronous contexts for node and browser. Inspired by zone.js and node domains.

Because I desperately need that for personal projects.

WORK IN PROGRESS, COMPLETELY EXPERIMENTAL FOR NOW

2024/04 Turns out it's already a thing in telemetry:
- "A Context is an object that contains the information for the sending and receiving service (or execution unit) to correlate one signal with another." https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/context-propagation/
- Propagation is the mechanism that moves context between services and processes.

Also "WorkContext" store data that is needed for the lifetime of a request, but should be discarded when the request exits. The usage of the data can span thread boundaries, for example, by using a Future or parallel streams.

MVP v2 - 2018/05

TODO remove full logger

## Introduction

Note: "Soft Execution Context" is abbreviated SXC everywhere.

Objectives:
* isomorphic, for node and browser
* reliably catch errors
  * either in a correctly chained path
  * or in any async path
* clear and exploitable errors
  * with an exploitable stack
  * with details
* basic dependency injection (DI), sort of React context
* can bubble events
  * ex. analytics can enrich details
* can abort a whole process and have a fallback
* not too slow (lots of forks)

BE DEFENSIVE !!!


## API

### Concepts

#### Hierarchy

Each SXC is linked to a parent, forming a graph.

Thus, a SXC is usually created from a parent with `parentSXC.createChild()`.

There is always a unique (singleton) top SXC. It is lazily created on call of `getRootSXC()`.

However, this root SXC can be customized like any other SXC.


### requisites
babel-polyfill may be needed? TODO check

### Methods

```js

SXC.injectDependencies({
	foo: 42,
})
const { ENV, SXC, logger, foo } = SXC.getInjectedDependencies()

/// SYNCHRONOUS
// won't catch
SXC.xTry(operation, ({SXC, logger}) => {
	...
})
// !! will auto-catch, be careful!! (ex. used at top level)
SXC.xTryCatch(...)


/// ASYNCHRONOUS
// classic Promise.try
return await SXC.xPromiseTry(operation, async ({SXC, logger}) => {
	...
})
// !! will auto-catch, be careful!!
SXC.xPromiseCatch(operation, promise)
SXC.xPromiseTryCatch(...)



SXC.setLogicalStack({
	module: LIB,
	operation: ...
})

SXC.getLogicalStack()
SXC.getShortLogicalStack()

SXC.emitter.emit('analytics', { SXC, eventId, details })
```

### Injections

| value                   | Injected | Analytics | Error context | notes |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------|---------------|------------- |
| `SXC`                   | yesâœ…    | -         | -             | the current Software Execution Context |
| `logger`                | yesâœ…     | -         | -             | default to console |
| `NODE_ENV`              | yesâœ…     | -         | -             | intended usage: if "development", may activate extra error checks, extra error reporting (cf. React) Mirror of NODE_ENV at evaluation time, defaulting to `'development'` if not set. `'production'` or `development` |
| `ENV`                   | yesâœ…     | yesâœ…      | yesâœ…       | less connoted alias of `NODE_ENV` ðŸ˜‰ |
| `IS_DEV_MODE`           | yesâœ…     | -         | -             | default to `false`. Used to activate dev commands or reportings, ex. extra settings, extra UI |
| `IS_VERBOSE`            | yesâœ…     | -         | -             | default to `false`. Used to activate extra reporting on tasks, intent like --verbose |
| `CHANNEL`               | yesâœ…     | yesâœ…      | yesâœ…          | current channel of rollout deployment. Default to `'dev'`. Suggested possible values: `'dev'`, `'staging'`, `'prod'` |
| `SESSION_START_TIME_MS` | yesâœ…     | -         | -             | UTC timestamp in ms of the time of start |
| `TIME`                  | -        | yesâœ…      | yesâœ…          | UTC timestamp in ms of the time of the error/analytics |
| `SESSION_DURATION_MS`   | -        | yesâœ…      | yesâœ…          | ms elapsed from the start of the session |
| `OS_NAME`               | yesâœ…*    | yesâœ…*     | yesâœ…*         | (Expected to be set by platform-specific code) |
| `DEVICE_UUID`           | -        | yesâœ…*     | yesâœ…*         | (Expected to be set by platform-specific code) |
| `VERSION`               | -        | yesâœ…*     | yesâœ…*         | (Expected to be set by the user) |
| `?`                     | -        | -         | -             |  |


### Event emitter

All SXC are sharing a common event emitter. Please do NOT abuse!

DO NOT EMIT SXC events, it's usually not what you want to do.

Events:
- `final-error`: an error than no SXC can handle or mitigate (usually a crash).
  This event should be listened to by final reporters, like Sentry,
  or to display a crash report.

Do NOT assume that there is an advanced logger! Only use the "console safe" ones
