## Pragmatic Graph data structure library

Includes:
- generic graph
- specific graph: file system representation (arborescence of folder, files)
- TODO craft
- TODO places and connexions

WARNING: only the features I need are implemented. For ex. NO node / vertex removal!

## Usage

- Note: reading some refresher links is highly recommended
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph
- Note: terminology
  - This lib uses the standard terminology form graph theory
  - I settled on `node`/`link` terminology for max clarity (over `vertex`/`edge` for ex.)
