UUID

TODO remove the monstrous dependency on crypto! or NOT USE nanoid!!

XXX uuid are not what we want! (esp. raw)
> UUID can be suboptimal for many use-cases because:
> * It isn't the most character efficient way of encoding 128 bits of randomness
> * UUID v1/v2 is impractical in many environments, as it requires access to a unique, stable MAC address
> * UUID v3/v5 requires a unique seed and produces randomly distributed IDs, which can cause fragmentation in many data structures
> * UUID v4 provides no other information than randomness which can cause fragmentation in many data structures
> https://github.com/ulid/spec
* Also see https://nitter.net/__steele/status/1570208081296134145
  * should be prefixed
  * should be layered
  * ULID Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier
