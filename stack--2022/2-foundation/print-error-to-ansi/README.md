## Improved display of an error on a terminal

The terminal (node.js) lacks the observability of the browser's console.
The default error display (console) is inferior and hard to detect + parse.

This lib solves all the issues ✅
* all fields are displayed
* "details" are displayed
* "cause" is displayed
* the stack is cleaned with 1) framesToPop 2) first useless line

Note:
* this lib relies on `@offirmo/error-utils` but is separated since specific to node.js / terminal
* this lib occusionally adds content not present on the error object. Such content is denoted by special brackets: `⟨...⟩`

Roadmap
* TODO MAYBE? improve stack display with https://www.stacktracejs.com/
