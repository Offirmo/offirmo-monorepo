## start of cultivation


https://xian-ni.fandom.com/wiki/Qi_Condensation
The Spirit Movement stage, which is also the Qi Condensation stage, is to use the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to refine the body from the inside out. This is all for laying the foundation for the Foundation Building stage.

This stage is divided into 15 layers, all but the first of which require a chant to break through to.

There are two breathing techniques one learns at this level, one called the Qi Gathering Technique and its exact opposite the Qi Scattering Technique, the former is used all the time to progress in Cultivation while the latter is used as a safety net during attempted breakthroughs, such as ascending to Foundation Establishment and beyond.

This step has two major bottlenecks at the peak 3rd layer and peak 5th layer respectively.

Stages

    First Level of Qi Condensation - Can start practicing techniques
    Second Level of Qi Condensation - Awaken Divine Sense.
    Third Level of Qi Condensation
        Bottleneck: "The key of breaking through has nothing to do with talent, but in one’s ability to understand the meaning behind the phrase “the road is merciless”."[1]
            According to Situ Nan, this phrase is complete nonsense spread around in the more rural sects.
    Fourth Level of Qi Condensation
    Fifth Level of Qi Condensation
        Bottleneck: The bottleneck at the 5th to 6th layer changes the quality of spiritual energy in your body. This requires a large amount of spiritual energy, so it becomes a bottleneck that blocks a lot of people.[1]
    Sixth Level of Qi Condensation
    Seventh Level of Qi Condensation
    Eighth Level of Qi Condensation
    Ninth Level of Qi Condensation

    Tenth Level of Qi Condensation
    Eleventh Level of Qi Condensation
    Twelfth Level of Qi Condensation
    Thirteenth Level of Qi Condensation
    Fourteen Level of Qi Condensation - Also called Spiritual Movement Half Circle
    Fifteenth Level of Qi Condensation

Trivia

    Situ Nan notes that the Qi Condensation and Spiritual Movement Stages are actually different equivalent practices. The latter is used in 4th Ranked Countries and above, and seems to require no chants to practice, making it clearly superior.



https://xian-ni.fandom.com/wiki/Foundation_Establishment

After gathering a sufficient amount of Spiritual Energy in the Qi Condensation/Spiritual Movement Stage(at least 14th layer, but most would still choose to wait until they reach the 15th layer) the Cultivator then works to cycle that spiritual energy through their entire body, in so doing the spiritual energy washes the body clean and refines it so that it becomes more suited for cultivation. This is what is called "forming/building a foundation" or the Foundation Establishment Stage.

This is the true first step on the path of Cultivation, with the Qi Condensation stage being nothing more than the preliminary steps toward it.
Methods

There are three main methods used to enter Foundation Establishment:

    The proper method, which involves using a large amount of Qi to refine the body on one's own. This is the hardest method, however.
    The more common method in Sects that have them is to have a Nascent Soul Cultivator use their own power to assist with the breakthrough.
    The act of stealing someone else's Foundation. This method has an absolute success rate if done right, but it requires a living Foundation Establishment Cultivator to be refined for the user's benefit. As a side benefit, the user will also gain at least some of the victim's innate talent. Furthermore, this is a demonic practice.

Stages

    Early Foundation Establishment
        Peak-Early Foundation Establishment - achieved when the user has twice as much Qi energy as they did when they first entered Foundation Establishment.
    Mid Foundation Establishment
    Late Foundation Establishment
    Peak Foundation Establishment

Trivia

    Early on in the books, Situ Nan notes that it's possible to enter Foundation Establishment at the later stages of Qi Condensation without actually completing it. It is however not recommended to do this.
    As shown by the Underworld Ascension Method, it is possible to Cultivate through the Foundation Establishment stage using pure Yin Qi instead of Spiritual Qi.

https://xian-ni.fandom.com/wiki/Underworld_Ascension_Method

The Underworld Ascension Method is a technique used to allow a Demonic Cultivator to reach the Core Formation stage at the fastest speed known. It cultivates Yin Qi. The Ancient Underworld Ascension Method was one of the Ji Realm cultivation method, what is actually used is a reorganized method with a slim chance to succeed.
