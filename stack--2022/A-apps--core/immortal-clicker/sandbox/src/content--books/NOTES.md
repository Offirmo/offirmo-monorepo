"books" in their generic sense

From wikipedia:
> As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length
> that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read.
> In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition,
> a usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained.
> In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.
