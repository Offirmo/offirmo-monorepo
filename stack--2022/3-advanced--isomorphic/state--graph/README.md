Generic Graph data structure

Note: I settled on node/link for the terminology for max clarity (over vertex/edge for ex.)

WARNING: only the features I needed are implemented. For ex. no node / vertex removal!

Also includes derived graph-based data structures:
- folder/file tree
- places/connections
- dependencies
