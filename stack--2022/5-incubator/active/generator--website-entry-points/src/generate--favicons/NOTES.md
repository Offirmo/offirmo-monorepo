> Caution: While PNGs can include transparency, providing transparent icons may cause unexpected issues on some operating systems. For example, iOS, iPadOS, and Android 8 and later fill in the transparency with a background color out of your control. For better compatibility, use a square non-transparent icon.

> If you need to pick only one icon size, it should be 512 by 512 pixels. However, providing more sizes is recommended including 192 by 192, 384 by 384, and 1024 by 1024 pixel-sized images, too.

> Caution: Some resources will suggest you add more icon sizes for Android, such as 48 by 48, 72 by 72, 96 by 96, 144 by 144, 168 by 168, 256 by 256. While you can add as many sizes as you want, these are no longer necessary as they are Android icon sizes for legacy devices; even if you still have some users expecting those resolutions, the browser will resize one of your shipped icons.
