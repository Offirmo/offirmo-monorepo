Use the power of AI WITH experienced developers who are the real DRI
Pros
- faster dev
- faster iteration
- traductions!

Still no reproducible outputs https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/reproducible_outputs_with_the_seed_parameter

tools able to "repair" an imperfect generation?

linters?

TODO use a repetitive seed
TODO linter ?
TODO code formatter
TODO "out of source" building??  cmake?
TODO "snowflake" with MVP etc.



use of an intermediate language that would later translate to formal language?
Have an AI fill a form of everything needed? (~graphql)

model to evaluate a model?

should NOT require a manual re-verification of everything on re-generation

have another AI review the code / output?
