Write a semantic, well-structured, state-of-the-art html page displaying rows of dancing animals and playing a music in loop.

In the code, the dancing animals are instantiated by an invocation of a web component called "animated-sprite-sheet" and taking the parameters: asset-url, sheetWidth, sheetHeight, rows, columns.

Select a suitable font from google font and use it.

To comply with laws, the website should also have a discreet footer with legal mentions, about, imprimat etc.

The page need to be SEO friendly and have all the needed items to be shareable on social media. Add all the things needed.

Key Points
Font Usage: We've selected "Roboto" from Google Fonts for its readability and modern appearance.
SEO and Social Media: Meta tags are included for SEO and social media sharing, ensuring the page is discoverable and shareable.
Web Component: The animated-sprite-sheet component needs to be defined in a separate JavaScript file, where you define its behavior and how it handles the provided attributes (e.g., asset-url, sheetWidth, etc.).
Legal Footer: A footer is included for legal mentions, privacy policy, and about links, adhering to compliance requirements.
Minimal Dependencies: This example relies on standard HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript for the web component, adhering to the requirement for minimal third-party dependencies.
Best Practices
Performance: Ensure images and audio are optimized for the web to reduce loading times.
Accessibility: Use semantic HTML and ensure the site is navigable via keyboard. Also, provide alternative texts for images and accessible content for all users.
Security: Use HTTPS for your website, and ensure any third-party libraries are up-to-date and secure.
Maintainability: Keep your code well-documented and structured, making it easy to update and maintain.
This blueprint provides a strong foundation for your viral webpage project, aligning with modern web development best practices while drawing inspiration from a classic internet phenomenon.
