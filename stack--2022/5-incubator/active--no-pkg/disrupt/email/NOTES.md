Nobody uses email
Good, email sucks shit. It's clunky, antiquated, prone to abuse, and a massive timesink. In previous jobs I would clock in to 200+ emails that I would need to categorize. Sure, you could argue Slack has the exact same problem with hundreds of messages across a variety of channels, but the key is that Slack already categorizes things for you by importance. There is a very clear built-in hierarchy of filters that help you instantly assess what takes priority at the start of your day. I intrinsically know that DMs and team channel notifications > new messages in #outrage-notifications (though to be fair, that channel rules and is a joy to scroll through). Email treats all messages as equally important, so notifications of massive fires and random company newsletters are considered the same. Filtering through all the garbage sucks, and I am glad that I simply Donâ€™t Have To Do That.
