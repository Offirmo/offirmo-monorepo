CAP Theorem -- Availability = Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
CAP Theorem -- Consistency = Every read receives the most recent write or an error
CAP Theorem -- Partition tolerance = The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.

well architected -- pillar -- cost optimization = avoiding unnecessary costs -- consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.
well architected -- pillar -- operational excellence = running and monitoring systems to deliver business value -- performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.
well architected -- pillar -- performance efficiency = using IT and computing resources efficiently and maintain this efficiency -- using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes
well architected -- pillar -- reliability = consistently and correctly perform intended functions, Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues -- includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.
well architected -- pillar -- security = protecting information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies -- Automate security best practices when possible, Apply security at all layers, Protect data in transit and at rest.
well architected -- pillar -- sustainability = minimizing the environmental impact of your technology -- Understand your impact, Establish sustainability goals, Maximize utilization, Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings, Use managed services, Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
