agents -- principals
agents = you provide a goal, They'll generate a task list and get to work https://zapier.com/blog/ai-agent/
AGI -- ANI -> AGI -> ASI = narrow(weak) / general(strong) / super[human](strong)
AGI ~ strong AI = can independently learn new problem-solving strategies that are not explicitly included in its original model or training data
AI - Artificial intelligence = intentionally vague term / "solving tasks or problems by computers/machines, which require a form of human-like intelligence"
AI -- weak AI = task specific

alignment -- generic = conform to predefined values, usually ethical or social values, Truthfulness, Harmlessness, Helpfulness
alignment -- super alignment =  https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment  https://openai.com/blog/superalignment-fast-grants
alignment =  making AI do what its users want it to do (and nothing more) see also "paper clip"
attention
attention -- flash attention =
BERT

learning -- Transfer learning = a technique where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task
LLM -- "Language Model for Dialogue Applications" (LaMDA) 137B model from Google AI
LLM -- "Pathways Language Model" (PaLM) 540B model from Google AI
LLMs - large language models
ML - machine learning https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning ~"subfield of AI that describes AI using data and algorithms without a programmer explicitly specifying the solution path through program code"
moat - We have no moat https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither
model (NN) = sort of snapshot of a trained neural network / brain = NN (structure + parameters) https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models
model -- efficiency
model -- Transformer model
NLG Natural Language Generation
NLP Natural Language Processing
NN Neural Networks "computer architecture inspired by the human brain"
parameter (NN)
parameter -- hyperparameter = values provided to the model from the outside to make adjustments that can influence the learning process and its performance, among other things
Pathways = broader AU architecture underpinning PaLM
Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image model (Parti), is an autoregressive text-to-image generation model that achieves high-fidelity photorealistic image generation and supports content-rich synthesis involving complex compositions and world knowledge.

research directions -- honesty, chain-of-thought faithfulness, adversarial robustness, evals and testbeds...
research directions -- Interpretability: How can we understand model internals? And can we use this to e.g. build an AI lie detector?
research directions -- Scalable oversight: How can we use AI systems to assist humans in evaluating the outputs of other AI systems on complex tasks?
research directions -- Weak-to-strong generalization: Humans will be weak supervisors relative to superhuman models. Can we understand and control how strong models generalize from weak supervision?
