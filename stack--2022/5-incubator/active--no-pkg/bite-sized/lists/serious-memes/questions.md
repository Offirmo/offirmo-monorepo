In the session, he gave me some provocations that I sometimes forget.

what is your intent behind the question?
- to be right?
- to catch the person out?
- to understand more?

where should you ask the question?
- public?
- private?
- in person?
- digitally?

what are you going to do with the answer
- why do you need to know this?
- do you care about the answer?
- are you giving the person chance to answer authentically?

test the question on yourself…out loud
- what’s your answer?
- does the question get to something interesting?

Don’t hide behind theory. Personal can never be wrong.

be curious rather than interrogate

SFTU and maybe STFU first :wink:
