Principles I want to use in my RPG(s)

- learn real stuff when possible (ex. animals, plants, skills...)
- teach civilization
- life is worth living
- there is good in everyone
- everyone is a teacher
- no grinding
- no ads or micro-transactions

Through action, a Man becomes a Hero
Through death, a Hero becomes a Legend
Through time, a Legend becomes a Myth
And by learning from the Myth, a Man takes action




Even the most ordinary person has the power to change the world
It is not hard to distinguish what is right and what is wrong in the universe. Listen to your heart.
Don't wait for luck. Forge your own destiny.
It is never too late to become the hero in your story
Stope dreaming, start doing
Heroes rise from the ground and fight their way up
It's not a matter of getting knocked down, but whether you get back up
Continuous refinement, not strength or intelligence, is the key to unlocking your full potential
Strength does not come from winning. It's when you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that's where you will find strength.
There are consequences to your beliefs. It is worth it.
When you feel like quitting, just remember why you started.
You are free to be whomever you wish to be.
Heroes can come from anywhere. Even a simple act of kindness will reassure someone the world is still good.
One cannot choose how life begins but one can forge the courage to write the chapter ahead.

"The greatest test of courage on earth is to bear defeat without losing heart." -- Robert Green Ingersoll
