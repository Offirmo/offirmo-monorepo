Principles I want to use in my RPG(s)

- learn real stuff when possible (ex. animals, plants, skills...)
- teach civilization
- life is worth living
- there is good in everyone
- everyone is a teacher
- no grinding
- no ads or micro-transactions
-



Through action, a Man becomes a Hero
Through death, a Hero becomes a Legend
Through time, a Legend becomes a Myth
And by learning from the Myth, a Man takes action
