    "* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding\n",
    "  * \"Some systems only permit the use of blocks consisting of 7-bit, printable text\" => \"ASCII armor\"\n",

    "  * variants\n",

    "* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9580#name-multiprecision-integers\n",
    "  * Multiprecision Integers (MPIs) are unsigned integers used to hold large integers such as the ones used in cryptographic calculations\n",
    "  * in some places, MPIs are used to encode non-integer data, such as an elliptic curve (EC) point\n",
    "  * or an octet string of known, fixed length\n",
    "  * A Key ID is an 8-octet scalar that identifies a key. Implementations SHOULD NOT assume that Key IDs are unique.\n",
    "  * A fingerprint is more likely to be unique than a Key ID. The fingerprint and Key ID of a key are calculated differently according to the version of the key.\n",
    "* Bitcoin\n",
    "  * initially Base58 = Like Base64 but excludes non-alphanumeric characters (+ and /) and pairs of characters that often look ambiguous when rendered: zero (0) and capitol-O (O), and capital-I (I) and lowercase-L (l) https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-msporny-base58-03.txt\n",
    "    * base58 has quadratic time complexity: use only when you have small constant sized input, because variable length sized input from user can cause DoS\n",
    "    * critic https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0173\n",
    "  * now Bech32\n",
    "    * https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0173#Specification\n",
    "    * The data portion is encoded like Base32 with the possibility to check and correct up to 6 mistyped characters using the 6-character BCH code at the end, which also checks/corrects the Human Readable Part\n",
    "    * XXX has an unexpected weakness: whenever the final character is a 'p', inserting or deleting any number of 'q' characters immediately preceding it does not invalidate the checksum\n",
    "      * The Bech32m variant has a subtle change that makes it more resilient to changes in length https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0350\n",
    "* Error correction\n",
    "  * an unfortunate side effect of error correction is that it erodes error detection: correction changes invalid inputs into valid inputs, but if more than a few errors were made then the valid input may not be the correct input. Use of an incorrect but valid input can cause funds to be lost irrecoverably.\n",
    "  * Because of this, implementations SHOULD NOT implement correction beyond potentially suggesting to the user where in the string an error might be found, without suggesting the correction to make. \n",
